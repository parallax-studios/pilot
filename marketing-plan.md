# PILOT — Marketing Plan

> "Marketing is not a phase. Marketing is a practice that runs parallel to development from the first commit. You start building the audience on day one, not day last."

This is the marketing plan for PILOT — the television development sim where your taste is the mechanic, every greenlight is a gamble, and the golden age of TV is yours to build or botch. This plan covers everything from the five-second hook to the launch-day content strategy. If it is not in this document, it does not happen.

Let's build the audience.

---

## 1. THE HOOK (Three Versions)

Every person who sees this game needs to understand it in three time spans: five seconds, thirty seconds, and two minutes. Here is what you say.

### 1.1 Five-Second Hook (The Scroll-Stop Line)

**"You decide what 20 million people watch. The show that becomes the next Sopranos is on your desk right now. Do you see it?"**

This is the tweet. This is the Reddit comment. This is the first line of every press email. It stops the scroll because it puts the player in a position of creative power and creative terror. The question mark is critical — it implies that the answer might be no, and that uncertainty is the hook.

### 1.2 Thirty-Second Hook (The Elevator Pitch)

**"PILOT is a television development sim set in the golden age of TV. You are the network exec who reads scripts, gives notes, and decides what gets made. Every greenlight is a bet on your taste. Every note you give shapes the show. Build a network of prestige masterpieces or populist hits — or burn through your budget chasing both. Game Dev Story meets Mad Men. Your taste is the mechanic."**

This is the Steam short description. This is the festival pitch. This is what you say when someone asks "what's your game about?" at a conference. It frontloads the setting (golden age TV), the player fantasy (you decide what gets made), the core tension (taste vs. commerce), and the comp (Game Dev Story meets Mad Men).

### 1.3 Two-Minute Hook (The Store Page Pitch)

**"It's 2002. You have just been promoted to VP of Development at a broadcast network that is bleeding viewers to cable. Your predecessor left behind a slate of aging procedurals and a desk full of safe bets. The network president wants a hit. What they mean is: a hit that looks like the last hit. What they do not say is: the last hit is why we are dying.**

**Your first week, a script lands on your desk. The coverage reader gave it a B+. The logline: 'A high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer turns to manufacturing meth.' The showrunner attached is a volatile genius fresh off a show that got 3 million viewers and critical raves. Your competitor wants it. Your boss wants another CSI clone. You read the script. The writing is on fire.**

**Do you greenlight it?**

**PILOT is the management sim where you do not just pick winners — you shape them. You read scripts. You attach showrunners. You give notes that change the DNA of the show. You fight for creative visions against test audiences, advertisers, and your own network president. Every decision you make builds your network's identity — prestige or populist, bold or safe, auteur-driven or producer-controlled. The industry around you is evolving. Cable is rising. Reality TV is booming. The audience is fragmenting. Your job is not just to survive. Your job is to define an era.**

**You are not managing television. You are tasting it. And taste is the hardest thing to teach."**

This is the long-form pitch. This is the Steam store page body text. This is the IGN preview article excerpt. It sets the scene, presents the core dilemma, explains the mechanics, and ends with the thesis: taste as a mechanic.

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCE

Know who this game is for. Know where they live. Know what they already play and watch. Marketing to "gamers" is marketing to no one.

### 2.1 Primary Audience — Strategy Sim Players Who Are TV Obsessives

**Demographics**:
- Age 25-45
- 60% male, 40% female (management sims skew slightly male, but TV fandom skews female — the crossover is the sweet spot)
- College-educated, likely works in creative or knowledge economy jobs
- Lives in urban or suburban areas with strong cultural engagement

**Psychographics**:
- Plays Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Football Manager, Crusader Kings
- Watches prestige TV religiously. Has opinions about whether The Wire or The Sopranos is better. Has watched The Bear, Succession, Barry, Breaking Bad, Mad Men
- Listens to TV podcasts (The Watch, Ringer TV, Previously On)
- Reads TV criticism (Vulture, The AV Club, Alan Sepinwall, Emily Nussbaum)
- Active on Reddit TV communities (r/television, r/TheSopranos, r/BreakingBad) and TV Twitter
- Argues about network scheduling, showrunner choices, and cancellation decisions in comments

**What They Want**:
- A management sim that respects their intelligence and their knowledge of the medium
- Decisions that feel personal, not spreadsheet optimization
- A game that understands the tension between art and commerce
- The fantasy of being the executive who greenlit the next great show

**Where They Are**:
- **Reddit**: r/television, r/tycoon, r/simulationgaming, r/BaseBuildingGames
- **Twitter**: TV Twitter (follows showrunners, critics, TV journalists), #TVTwitter hashtag
- **YouTube**: Noclip documentaries, Game Maker's Toolkit, Inside Gaming, Girlfriend Reviews
- **Podcasts**: The Watch, The Ringer, Previously On, Scriptnotes (for TV industry deep dives)
- **Letterboxd**: Increasingly used for TV logging, not just films

**The Hook for Them**:
"There is finally a game about the job you wish you had — the person who decides what gets made and what gets killed. Your taste is the mechanic."

### 2.2 Secondary Audience — Narrative Game Players Who Love Industry Settings

**Demographics**:
- Age 22-40
- 50% male, 50% female (narrative games skew gender-neutral)
- Drawn to games about creative work, moral ambiguity, and character-driven stories

**Psychographics**:
- Plays Disco Elysium, Pentiment, Kentucky Route Zero, The Beginner's Guide, Citizen Sleeper
- Watches prestige TV but also reads about the industry (Variety, The Hollywood Reporter)
- Values writing, dialogue, and thematic depth over mechanical complexity
- Intrigued by Hollywood/entertainment industry settings (loved The Player, Mad Men, Birdman, The Comeback)

**What They Want**:
- A game where the decisions are about creative values, not just resources
- Characters who feel real, flawed, and human
- A story about the cost of taste
- The Notes System — the idea that you give feedback on creative work and see the consequences

**Where They Are**:
- **Steam**: Wishlist queues that include Disco Elysium, Pentiment, Citizen Sleeper, The Case of the Golden Idol
- **itch.io**: Narrative indie game scene
- **Twitter**: Indie game Twitter, narrative design Twitter (follow Emily Short, Raph Koster, Alexa Ray Corriea)
- **YouTube**: MandaloreGaming, Jacob Geller, Noah Caldwell-Gervais (long-form game analysis)

**The Hook for Them**:
"A management sim that is secretly a game about the moral injury of compromise. Every note you give is a tiny betrayal — of someone's vision or of your audience's trust."

### 2.3 Tertiary Audience — Casual Management Sim Players

**Demographics**:
- Age 18-50
- Platform-agnostic (play on PC, mobile, console)
- Bounce between Game Dev Story on mobile and Planet Coaster on Steam

**Psychographics**:
- Plays management sims for relaxation and the "one more turn" loop
- Not necessarily TV obsessives, but drawn to fresh settings
- 2000s nostalgia is a hook (they were teens/young adults during this era)

**What They Want**:
- A familiar management sim structure (triage, develop, launch, see results) in a fresh setting
- Accessible mechanics with depth for those who want it
- Nostalgia trip (BlackBerries, early DVRs, the upfronts, the trades)

**Where They Are**:
- **Steam**: "Recommended if you liked" algorithms will surface PILOT to Game Dev Tycoon / Megaquarium wishlists
- **Mobile**: (not launch platform, but these players will port over if reviews are strong)
- **YouTube**: Let's Players, casual sim content (Blitz, GrayStillPlays, Let's Game It Out)

**The Hook for Them**:
"Game Dev Tycoon, but you are making TV shows in the 2000s, and the creative notes system is unlike anything you have played."

### 2.4 Secret Weapon Audience — TV Industry Professionals

**Demographics**:
- Age 28-55
- Showrunners, writers' room staffers, development executives, agents, TV journalists
- Small but LOUD audience

**Psychographics**:
- They lived this. They know the pain of test audiences, the politics of notes, the terror of the upfronts
- They will play it, tweet about it, argue about its accuracy, and generate organic buzz that money cannot buy

**What They Want**:
- A game that gets it right — the texture, the language, the pressure
- To relive the era or to process trauma (depending on how their careers went)
- To feel seen

**Where They Are**:
- **Twitter**: TV writer Twitter, Hollywood industry Twitter (large, engaged community)
- **Podcasts**: Scriptnotes (John August, Craig Mazin), The Moment with Brian Koppelman
- **Private Discords and Slacks**: Writers' rooms stay connected, agents gossip, the industry is a village

**The Hook for Them**:
"Someone made a game about your job. It is actually good. And it hurts in the right ways."

**Strategy for Them**:
- Seed the game to 5-10 TV writers, showrunners, and journalists pre-launch
- A single tweet from a verified TV writer saying "holy shit, this is accurate" is worth $50K in paid ads
- Do not oversell. Let them discover it. The industry hates being pandered to but loves being understood.

## 3. MARKETING TIMELINE — 12 Months to Launch

Marketing starts NOW. Not six weeks before launch. Not when the Steam page goes live. NOW. The audience is built over months, not days.

### PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Months -12 to -9) — Before Announcement

**Goal**: Build awareness within the target audience without a formal announcement. Test messaging. Seed the concept.

**Activities**:

**Month -12 (Now)**:
- [ ] Register social media handles: @PILOTgame on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok (even if not using all platforms yet)
- [ ] Secure domain: pilotgame.com (or playPILOT.com if pilotgame is taken)
- [ ] Set up private Discord for dev team + early playtesters
- [ ] Create a one-page pitch deck with concept art (for press/influencer seeding)

**Month -11**:
- [ ] Commission key art (the mahogany desk covered in scripts, hand hovering, the LA skyline through the window)
- [ ] Key art is THE marketing asset. Every piece of promo material flows from this. Do not skimp.
- [ ] Begin reaching out to 3-5 TV writers/journalists via DM: "We are making a game about TV development. Would you be willing to give feedback on the concept?"
- [ ] Do NOT ask them to promote it. Ask for their expertise. People love being experts. Promotion comes later, organically.

**Month -10**:
- [ ] Produce a 30-second concept teaser (no gameplay yet, just vibes):
  - Montage: script pages flipping, coverage sheets with grades, a hand circling a date in red, a rough cut playing on a monitor, a conference room argument (text overlays only, no VO)
  - End card: "PILOT. Coming 2027. Wishlist now."
- [ ] Post teaser to Twitter, Reddit (r/television, r/tycoon, r/gaming), YouTube
- [ ] Track response. Is the hook landing? Are people confused or intrigued? Adjust messaging.

**Month -9**:
- [ ] Steam page goes live THE MOMENT the desk screenshot is production-ready
- [ ] Steam page copy: 30-second hook + 3 GIFs (desk triage, notes system, upfronts presentation)
- [ ] Press embargo lifts. Send pitch deck + concept teaser to 20 targeted outlets:
  - **Tier 1**: IGN, PC Gamer, Polygon, Kotaku, Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun
  - **Tier 2**: Indie game press (IndieGames.com, Siliconera, GameDeveloper.com)
  - **Tier 3**: TV press (Variety gaming section, Hollywood Reporter tech section, Vulture)
- [ ] Pitch angle: "A management sim about the golden age of TV, from the developers of [studio name]"
- [ ] Goal: 3-5 preview articles within 4 weeks

**Success Metrics**:
- 500 Steam wishlists within first month of page going live
- 1,000+ Twitter followers
- At least one TV industry professional tweets about the concept positively

---

### PHASE 2: ANNOUNCEMENT (Months -8 to -6) — Make Noise

**Goal**: Formal announcement. Drive Steam wishlists. Build community.

**Activities**:

**Month -8 (Announcement Month)**:
- [ ] Announce the game with a proper announcement trailer (60-90 seconds):
  - Structure: Hook (the pitch), Mechanics (triage scripts, give notes, see consequences), Setting (2000s, golden age), Comp (Game Dev Story meets Mad Men), End card (Wishlist now)
  - Show GAMEPLAY. Not just concept art. The desk with scripts. The notes screen with a dilemma. The upfronts presentation.
  - VO script: First-person, player perspective. "I killed the greatest show never made because I was scared of the ratings. Then I gave its time slot to a cop procedural that ran for nine seasons. I still think about it."
  - End on the hook: "What gets made is up to you."
- [ ] Trailer goes live on YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Steam
- [ ] Coordinate press embargo lift: all preview articles publish on announcement day
- [ ] Reddit AMA on r/Games or r/television (dev team + a TV writer consultant if you can get one)
- [ ] Goal: 5,000 Steam wishlists within first week of announcement

**Month -7**:
- [ ] Dev blog series begins (once per month, posted to Steam, Medium, personal site):
  - **Blog 1**: "Why We Made a Game About TV Development" (the pitch, the inspiration, why this era matters)
  - **Blog 2**: "Designing the Notes System" (how creative feedback became a game mechanic)
  - **Blog 3**: "Building the 2000s" (research, period accuracy, the texture of the era)
- [ ] Each blog post is also a Twitter thread (10-15 tweets), Reddit post, and Steam announcement
- [ ] Goal: Keep the conversation alive between major beats

**Month -6**:
- [ ] Twitter content plan: 3-4 posts per week
  - **Monday**: Industry trivia ("Did you know that [real TV fact]? In PILOT, you navigate dynamics like this.")
  - **Wednesday**: Gameplay GIF (a script landing on the desk, a note being given, a show being killed)
  - **Friday**: Community question ("What is the riskiest creative choice you have seen a network make? Reply below.")
- [ ] Begin building email list: "Sign up for dev updates and behind-the-scenes content." Mailchimp or ConvertKit. Embed signup on website and Steam page.

**Success Metrics**:
- 10,000 Steam wishlists by end of Month -6
- 3,000+ Twitter followers
- 500+ Discord members (if public Discord is opened)
- Email list: 1,000+ subscribers

---

### PHASE 3: MOMENTUM (Months -5 to -3) — Demos, Festivals, Influencers

**Goal**: Get the game into players' hands. Steam Next Fest demo. Festival presence. Influencer coverage.

**Activities**:

**Month -5**:
- [ ] Prepare vertical slice demo for Steam Next Fest (target: Next Fest 3-4 months before launch)
  - Demo scope: One full development season (triage 10 scripts, develop 3 pilots, give notes, present at upfronts)
  - Demo length: 20-30 minutes of core loop. End on a cliffhanger (your first series premiere ratings, frozen mid-reveal).
  - Demo must showcase the Notes System. That is the hook. Players need to FEEL giving a note and seeing the consequence.
- [ ] Submit to 3-5 indie game festivals (preferably those with demo booths or streaming showcases):
  - GDC Indie Showcase (if timing works)
  - PAX East/West Indie MEGABOOTH
  - Day of the Devs
  - IndieCade
- [ ] Reach out to 10-15 indie game influencers for demo keys (YouTube, Twitch):
  - **Target creators**: Wanderbots, Retromation, Aliensrock, Northernlion, splattercat (management sim players with engaged audiences)
  - **Pitch angle**: "We made a TV development sim where taste is the mechanic. Here's a demo key. No obligations, but we'd love to see you play it."

**Month -4 (Steam Next Fest Month)**:
- [ ] Steam Next Fest live event (7 days of demo availability)
- [ ] Developer livestream on Steam: Play through the demo, answer chat questions, show behind-the-scenes concept art
- [ ] Twitter/Reddit push: "The PILOT demo is live for 7 days. Wishlist if you like it, roast us if you don't."
- [ ] Track demo metrics: Conversion rate (demo downloads to wishlists), average playtime, drop-off points
- [ ] Post-Next Fest survey: Email all demo players with a 5-question survey ("What did you like? What confused you? Would you buy this?")

**Month -3**:
- [ ] Influencer coverage begins (YouTube videos, Twitch streams from demo keys sent in Month -5)
- [ ] Retweet/share every piece of influencer coverage. Build relationships. Comment on their videos. Engage.
- [ ] Press follow-up: Send demo keys to outlets that covered the announcement. Pitch hands-on previews.
- [ ] Community content: User-generated "what would you greenlight?" threads on Reddit/Twitter. Feature the best responses in a blog post.

**Success Metrics**:
- 25,000 Steam wishlists by end of Month -3
- 10,000+ demo downloads during Next Fest
- 10-15 influencer videos/streams
- 5+ hands-on preview articles

---

### PHASE 4: HYPE CYCLE (Months -2 to Launch) — Build to Release

**Goal**: Convert wishlists to purchases. Launch day dominance.

**Activities**:

**Month -2**:
- [ ] Announce launch date (specific date, not "Q2 2027")
- [ ] Launch date announcement trailer (30 seconds, repurposed footage + new footage, end card with date and price)
- [ ] Pre-orders open (if doing pre-orders; otherwise, just reconfirm wishlist-to-launch conversion messaging)
- [ ] Discounts for wishlisters: "Wishlist now, get 10% off at launch" (Steam supports this natively)
- [ ] Influencer embargo lifts: Send final review builds to 20-30 YouTubers/streamers with embargo date (launch day or 1 day before)
- [ ] Press review embargo lifts 1 day before launch

**Month -1 (The Final Push)**:
- [ ] Weekly content drops:
  - **Week 1**: "Meet the Characters" (Richard Kessler, Diane Valdez, Tommy Morell, etc. — short character bios with concept art)
  - **Week 2**: "The Notes System Deep Dive" (blog post + video showing 3 creative dilemmas and their consequences)
  - **Week 3**: "The 2000s TV Landscape" (infographic showing the era's trends, real shows that inspired the game)
  - **Week 4**: "Launch Trailer" (90 seconds, the definitive version — gameplay, hook, reviews quotes if available, launch date)
- [ ] Discord event: "Ask the devs anything" AMA 1 week before launch
- [ ] Reddit AMA on r/Games 3 days before launch
- [ ] Email blast to mailing list: "PILOT launches in 3 days. Here's what to expect."

**Launch Week**:
- [ ] Launch day: Game goes live on Steam
- [ ] Launch day livestream: Devs play the full first season, answer chat questions, celebrate
- [ ] Press kit updated with launch info, review quotes, high-res screenshots, trailer embeds
- [ ] Monitor reviews (Steam, Metacritic, social media). Respond to feedback publicly.
- [ ] Launch discount: 10% off for first week to reward wishlisters and drive impulse purchases
- [ ] Tweet every review, every Let's Play, every fan post. The community is fragile at launch. Make them feel seen.

**Post-Launch (Week 1-4)**:
- [ ] Patch 1.0.1 within first week (address any critical bugs or balance issues flagged by players)
- [ ] Post-launch content plan: Weekly dev blogs on Steam ("What we're learning from your feedback," "Patch notes," "What's next")
- [ ] Community highlights: Feature fan content (screenshots of their networks, stories of shows they greenlit/killed)
- [ ] Influencer wave 2: Send keys to larger creators who didn't cover pre-launch (IGN, GameSpot, Skill Up, ACG)

**Success Metrics**:
- 50,000 Steam wishlists by launch
- 5,000 copies sold in first week (10% wishlist-to-purchase conversion is standard)
- 80%+ positive Steam reviews (Very Positive rating)
- 10+ review scores (target: 80+ Metacritic if enough outlets cover)

---

## 4. STORE PAGE STRATEGY — The Conversion Engine

The Steam store page is the single most important marketing asset. More people will see this page than any trailer, any article, any tweet. Optimize it ruthlessly.

### 4.1 Steam Short Description (300 characters max)

**"You're the network exec who decides what America watches. Read scripts, give notes, greenlight shows. Game Dev Story meets Mad Men. The golden age of TV is yours to build — or botch. Your taste is the mechanic."**

(298 characters. Fits the limit. Hook, comp, setting, thesis.)

### 4.2 Steam Long Description (5,000 characters max)

Use the two-minute hook from section 1.3 as the opening. Then add:

**What You Do:**
- Triage 15-20 scripts per season. Read coverage, scan loglines, deep-read the ones that intrigue you.
- Develop 8-12 pilots. Attach showrunners, negotiate casting, allocate budgets.
- Give notes. The soul of the game. Shape the creative vision — protect the auteur or chase the demo.
- Present at the upfronts. Sell your slate to advertisers. Your presentation determines your budget.
- Launch shows. Watch the ratings come in. Renew, cancel, adjust. Build your network's identity.

**Key Features:**
- **The Notes System**: Your creative feedback on pilots is the primary gameplay verb. Every note you give changes the show's quality ceiling, commercial floor, and your relationship with the showrunner.
- **Network Identity**: Your decisions accumulate into a visible brand profile. Prestige or populist. Bold or safe. Auteur-driven or producer-controlled. The industry reacts to who you are.
- **Living Industry Simulation**: Competing networks develop their own slates. Cable rises. Reality booms. The 2000s TV landscape evolves around you, and you must adapt or die.
- **The Upfronts**: Present your slate to advertisers in a high-stakes set-piece moment. The room's reaction determines your revenue for the season.
- **8-Season Campaign**: 2002-2010. Navigate the golden age from The Sopranos to the brink of streaming. Your career retrospective plays at the end. Are you proud of what you built?

**For Fans Of:**
- Game Dev Tycoon, Football Manager (management sims with emotional investment)
- Mad Men, The Player (industry settings with moral ambiguity)
- Disco Elysium, Pentiment (narrative depth, choices that matter)

End with: **"What gets made is up to you. Wishlist now."**

4. Payoff (60-75 sec): "Build a network. Define an era. What gets made is up to you."
5. End card (75-90 sec): Title, launch date, price, "Wishlist now" CTA

---

## 5. SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT PLAN — Feed the Algorithm

Consistency beats virality. Post 3-4 times per week, every week, for 12 months. Build the habit, build the audience.

### 5.1 Content Pillars (What to Post)

**Pillar 1: Industry Trivia / TV History**
- Monday posts
- Example: "In 2004, Lost premiered to 18.6 million viewers and changed serialized TV forever. In PILOT, you decide whether to greenlight a serialized mystery when the industry says it's too risky."
- Format: Image (a vintage TV Guide cover, a trade magazine headline) + caption
- Goal: Engage TV obsessives, show that the game understands the medium

**Pillar 2: Gameplay GIFs / Screenshots**
- Wednesday posts
- Example: "You have 10 scripts on your desk. 3 expire tomorrow. Which do you prioritize?" + GIF of the desk interface
- Format: Gameplay GIF or screenshot + question to drive engagement
- Goal: Show the game, drive wishlists

**Pillar 3: Community Engagement**
- Friday posts
- Example: "What's the most controversial cancellation decision you've seen a network make? (We're looking at you, Firefly.)"
- Format: Text question, no image required (or a relevant meme image)
- Goal: Start conversations, build community, let the audience talk about TV (they LOVE talking about TV)

**Pillar 4: Dev Insights / Behind-the-Scenes**
- Bi-weekly, Saturday or Sunday
- Example: "Designing the Notes System: How we turned creative feedback into a game mechanic. Thread below." (1/12)
- Format: Twitter thread (10-15 tweets), or a single image with a link to a blog post
- Goal: Show the craft, attract game dev Twitter, give depth to the marketing

### 5.2 Platform Strategy

**Twitter (@PILOTgame)**:
- Primary platform. TV Twitter is massive and engaged.
- Post 3-4x per week (Pillar 1 Mon, Pillar 2 Wed, Pillar 3 Fri, Pillar 4 every other weekend)
- Engage with replies. Retweet fan content. Quote-tweet influencer coverage.
- Use hashtags sparingly: #IndieGame, #PILOT, #GameDev (only when relevant, not every post)

**Reddit**:
- Post 1-2x per month to r/television, r/tycoon, r/simulationgaming
- Reddit hates self-promotion, so frame posts as discussion starters:
  - "What's the hardest creative compromise you've seen in TV? Working on a game about this." (with context about PILOT in comments, not the post title)
  - "We made a TV development sim. Here's how the Notes System works." (dev blog link + invitation to AMA in comments)
- Upvotes are fickle. One well-framed post can hit 1K+ upvotes and drive hundreds of wishlists. Ten poorly framed posts get 3 upvotes and die.

**Discord**:
- Open to public 3 months before launch (Month -5)
- Channels: #general, #feedback, #show-and-tell (players share their network profiles), #tv-talk (off-topic TV discussions)
- Dev presence: Check in 2-3x per week. Answer questions. Share WIP screenshots.
- Goal: Build the core community. These are the players who will defend the game on Reddit and Twitter when trolls appear.

**YouTube (PILOTgame channel)**:
- Post trailers, dev blogs (video versions), and gameplay deep dives
- Not a primary platform (you're not trying to become a YouTuber), but essential for hosting video content that embeds on Steam, press kits, and tweets
- 10-20K views per video is a success for a small indie. Do not chase virality. Chase utility.

**TikTok / Instagram**:
- Nice-to-have, not essential
- IF the team has bandwidth, post 15-30 second clips (GIFs turned into videos, quick "did you know?" TV facts, reaction bait like "You have to cancel one of these shows — which one?")
- TikTok indie game success is rare but explosive when it hits. Low priority unless a team member is already TikTok-native.

**Letterboxd**:
- Create a PILOT account, log every fictional show from the game as a "film" (with fake posters, loglines, and reviews from the perspective of the in-game critics)
- Weird, niche, but Letterboxd TV users exist and they are EXACTLY the target audience
- Low effort, high engagement from a very specific audience

### 5.3 Community Management Rules

**Respond to**:
- Questions about the game (mechanics, release date, platform)
- Constructive criticism ("I played the demo and X felt off")
- Fan content (screenshots, fan art, discussion threads)

**Ignore**:
- Bad-faith trolls ("this looks boring," "who cares about TV")
- Platform wars ("why isn't this on Xbox," "PC gaming is dead")
- Piracy discussions

**Never**:
- Argue with players
- Promise features that are not locked in
- Apologize for the game's premise (if someone says "this sounds boring," let it go — they are not the audience)

## 6. PRESS OUTREACH STRATEGY — Earned Media

Press coverage is force multiplication. One IGN article reaches more people than 1,000 tweets.

### 6.1 Press Target List (Tier 1: Must-Have Coverage)

| Outlet | Contact Type | Pitch Angle |
|---|---|---|
| **PC Gamer** | Games Editor | "A management sim where taste is the mechanic. Game Dev Story meets Mad Men." |
| **IGN** | Indie Game Editor | "The TV development sim you didn't know you wanted. Notes System deep dive." |
| **Polygon** | Features Editor | "Making a game about the golden age of TV — and why the 2000s matter." |
| **Rock Paper Shotgun** | Indie Coverage | "How we turned creative compromise into a gameplay verb." |
| **Eurogamer** | Features | "PILOT and the challenge of simulating taste." |
| **Kotaku** | News + Features | "A sim about the job every TV fan wishes they had." |

**Pitch Email Template** (sent 4-6 months before launch):

**Subject**: PILOT — A TV Development Sim Where Taste is the Mechanic

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], [role] at [Studio]. We're making PILOT — a management sim about television development in the 2000s. You're the network exec who reads scripts, gives notes, and decides what 20 million people watch.

**Why this might interest you**:
- It's Game Dev Tycoon meets Mad Men — a management sim in a setting that has never been done
- The Notes System is the hook: you give creative feedback on pilots, and every note shapes the show's DNA
- The era (2002-2010, the golden age of TV) is rich with tension between art and commerce
- The game asks: is it possible to be a gatekeeper and still have a soul?

**Where we're at**:
- [Announcement trailer / demo / launch date] is [live / coming in X weeks]
- Steam page is live: [link]
- We'd love to send you a preview build or hop on a call to show you the Notes System in action

Let me know if you're interested. No pressure if it's not a fit.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
[Contact info]

### 6.2 Press Target List (Tier 2: Nice-to-Have Coverage)

| Outlet | Pitch Angle |
|---|---|
| **GameDeveloper.com** | "How we designed the Notes System — turning creative feedback into gameplay" |
| **IndieGames.com** | Standard indie coverage |
| **Siliconera** | "PILOT and the challenge of adapting real-world industries into sims" |
| **TouchArcade** (if mobile port happens) | Mobile sim coverage |

### 6.3 Press Target List (Tier 3: Cross-Industry Coverage)

| Outlet | Pitch Angle |
|---|---|
| **Variety (Gaming Section)** | "A game about the TV industry, made with actual TV consultants" |
| **Hollywood Reporter (Tech Section)** | "How games are exploring Hollywood systems — PILOT and the golden age of TV" |
| **Vulture** | "A game that lets you live the fantasy of greenlighting the next Sopranos" |

**Why cross-industry press matters**: TV industry outlets reach TV professionals, who tweet about it, which reaches TV fans, who are the core audience. One Hollywood Reporter article generates more Twitter buzz than ten game press articles.

### 6.4 Influencer Outreach (YouTube / Twitch)

**Tier 1 (10K-100K subscribers, management sim players)**:
- Wanderbots, Retromation, Aliensrock, Northernlion, splattercat, EnterElysium
- Pitch: "We made a TV development sim. Here's a demo key. We'd love to see you play it, but no obligations."

**Tier 2 (100K-1M subscribers, general indie coverage)**:
- Nookrium, Blitz, GrayStillPlays, Let's Game It Out
- Pitch: Same as Tier 1, but emphasize the chaos potential ("What happens if you only greenlight sci-fi shows? We want to see.")

**Tier 3 (1M+ subscribers, review-focused)**:
- Skill Up, ACG, Gameranx
- Pitch: "Review build available [X weeks before launch]. Happy to answer any questions."

**Influencer Outreach Rules**:
- Send keys, not obligations. Influencers get 50 pitches a day. Respect their time.
- Personalize the email. "I saw your Game Dev Tycoon video — you'd love this" > generic blast.
- Follow up ONCE if no response. Then let it go.
- Do not ask for coverage in exchange for keys. That's against FTC rules and also gross.

## 7. COMMUNITY BUILDING STRATEGY — Turn Players Into Evangelists

The goal is not just to sell copies. The goal is to build a community that defends the game, creates content, and recruits new players.

### 7.1 Discord Server Structure (Opens Month -5)

**Channels**:
- **#announcements** (dev-only, major updates)
- **#general** (open discussion)
- **#feedback** (bug reports, feature requests, balance concerns)
- **#show-and-tell** (players share screenshots of their networks, stories of shows they greenlit/killed)
- **#tv-talk** (off-topic TV discussions — let the community bond over shared love of the medium)
- **#dev-corner** (weekly dev check-ins, behind-the-scenes, WIP screenshots)

**Moderation**:
- 2-3 volunteer mods from the community (recruited after 1-2 months of activity)
- Clear rules (no bigotry, no spam, no piracy, no spoilers without tags)
- Dev presence 2-3x per week (answer questions, share updates, engage in #tv-talk)

**Events**:
- **Month -3**: "Name a Fictional Show" contest (community submits loglines for shows in the game, winner gets their show + name in credits)
- **Month -1**: "Dev AMA" (live text AMA in Discord, 2 hours, all questions answered)
- **Launch Week**: "Share Your Network" event (players post screenshots, best one gets retweeted by official account + featured in a blog post)

### 7.2 Reddit Presence

**Subreddit Strategy**:
- Do NOT create r/PILOTgame at launch. Wait until the community is large enough to sustain it (2K+ wishlists minimum).
- Until then, engage in r/television, r/tycoon, r/simulationgaming, r/Games

**Reddit AMA Strategy**:
- Host 2 AMAs: one at announcement (Month -8), one 3 days before launch
- AMA structure:
  - 2-hour window
  - Dev team answers questions in real-time
  - Proof: Tweet from official account confirming the AMA
  - Answer 50-100 questions, prioritize high-upvote questions and thoughtful questions over memes

### 7.3 User-Generated Content

**Encourage**:
- Screenshots of network profiles ("Here's my prestige boutique network after 8 seasons")
- Stories ("I greenlit a serialized drama in season 2 that got 2M viewers. By season 5 it was pulling 12M. I was right and the test audience was wrong.")
- Fan art (rare for a management sim, but if someone draws Richard Kessler or Diane Valdez, FEATURE IT EVERYWHERE)

**Showcase**:
- Retweet/share the best fan content weekly
- Create a "Community Spotlight" blog post once per month featuring fan stories, screenshots, and feedback
- Add a "Player Stories" section to the website

---

## 10. POST-LAUNCH CONTENT STRATEGY — Keep the Momentum

Launch is not the end. It is week 1 of a 12-month campaign.

### 10.1 Post-Launch Content Pillars

**Weeks 2-4**:
- Weekly dev blogs on Steam ("What we learned from launch week," "Patch 1.0.2 notes," "Roadmap for the next 3 months")
- Community highlights: Feature player stories, network profiles, creative decisions
- Sales: Monitor for any post-launch sales opportunities (Steam seasonal sales, bundle inclusions)

**Months 2-3**:
- First content update (free): New fictional pilots, new showrunner profiles, quality-of-life improvements
- Steam sale: 15-20% off during a seasonal sale (Spring/Summer sale)
- Influencer re-engagement: Send updated builds to creators who covered at launch

**Months 4-6**:
- Major update (free or small paid DLC): "The Streaming Era" expansion (2010-2015, add Netflix as a competitor, new mechanics for binge audiences)
- Press push: "PILOT adds the streaming wars in new expansion"
- Festival circuit: Submit to more festivals with post-launch accolades ("80+ Metacritic," "Very Positive on Steam")

### 10.2 Community Events (Ongoing)

- **Monthly**: "Network of the Month" — feature a player's network profile on social media and in the Steam community
- **Quarterly**: Dev AMA in Discord
- **Annually**: "PILOT Awards" — community votes on best fictional show, best network build, funniest disaster story

### 10.3 Long-Tail Strategy

**Year 1 Post-Launch**:
- 4 content updates (mix of free QOL updates and small paid DLC)
- 2 major Steam sales (25% off)
- Maintain social media presence (1-2 posts per week, down from pre-launch 3-4)

**Year 2+**:
- Port to Nintendo Switch (new audience, new sales spike)
- Port to Mac (day-one parity ideally, but if delayed, Year 2 is acceptable)
- Sequel or major expansion discussions based on sales performance

## 11. BUDGET ESTIMATE — What This Costs

Marketing is not free. Here is what you spend and where.

| Line Item | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Key Art Commission** | $2,000-$5,000 | Hire a professional illustrator. This is the hero image for EVERY piece of marketing. Do not cheap out. |
| **Trailer Production** (if outsourced) | $3,000-$8,000 | Includes editing, VO talent, sound design. If done in-house, cost drops to $500-$1,000 (VO actor + music licensing). |
| **Steam Marketing Tools** (visibility rounds, featured spots) | $1,000-$3,000 | Steam charges for some promotional placements. Budget for at least one visibility round. |
| **Press Kit Hosting + Website** | $200-$500/year | Domain ($15/year) + hosting ($10/month) + press kit page design. |
| **Paid Ads** (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) | $2,000-$5,000 (optional) | Low ROI for indie games. Only spend if organic reach plateaus and you have budget to burn. Better spent on influencer keys and festival fees. |
| **Festival Submission Fees** | $500-$1,500 | GDC, PAX, IndieCade entry fees. $50-$300 per festival. Budget for 5-10 submissions. |
| **Influencer Key Budget** | $0 (keys are free) | Send 50-100 keys. Cost is $0 in cash, but allocate dev time for outreach emails and follow-ups. |
| **Community Management Tools** (Discord Nitro, Mailchimp) | $300-$500/year | Discord server boost ($10/month), Mailchimp or ConvertKit for email list ($15-$30/month). |
| **Contingency / Misc** | $1,000-$2,000 | Unexpected costs (a last-minute PR push, a sponsored tweet from a creator, etc.). |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED MARKETING BUDGET** | **$10,000-$25,000** | Scales based on studio size and ambition. $10K is scrappy indie. $25K is polished indie with festival presence. |

**What You DON'T Spend On**:
- Paid ads (low ROI for indie games, organic reach + influencer coverage is better)
- PR agency (too expensive for most indies unless you have $50K+ to spend)
- Booth space at major expos (PAX booths cost $5K-$15K+; only worth it if you're already established)

**What You DO Spend Time On**:
- Writing press emails (free, time-intensive)
- Managing social media (free, time-intensive)
- Engaging with the community (free, time-intensive)
- Reaching out to influencers (free, time-intensive)

Marketing is labor. Budget your TIME as much as your money.

## 12. SUCCESS METRICS — How We Measure

Define success before you launch. Here are the targets.

### 12.1 Steam Wishlists

| Milestone | Target | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Announcement | 1,000 wishlists | Week 1 post-announcement |
| 3 Months Pre-Launch | 10,000 wishlists | Month -6 |
| 1 Month Pre-Launch | 25,000 wishlists | Month -3 |
| Launch Day | 50,000 wishlists | Month 0 |

**Why these numbers**: 50K wishlists at launch = 5K-10K week-1 sales (10-20% conversion rate is industry standard). 5K sales at $19.99 = $100K gross revenue, minus Steam's 30% cut = $70K net. That funds the next project.

### 12.2 Sales Targets

| Milestone | Target | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | 5,000 copies | Launch week |
| Month 1 | 10,000 copies | End of Month 1 |
| Month 6 | 25,000 copies | Half-year mark |
| Year 1 | 50,000 copies | Anniversary |

**Revenue at 50K copies sold**:
- 50K copies x $19.99 = $999,500 gross
- Minus Steam cut (30%) = $699,650 net
- Minus marketing budget ($10K-$25K) = $675K-$690K net
- That is a successful indie launch. Funds the team for 1-2 years.

### 12.3 Community Metrics

| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Twitter Followers | 5,000 | Launch |
| Discord Members | 1,000 | Launch |
| Email List Subscribers | 2,000 | Launch |
| Steam Reviews (Week 1) | 200+ | Week 1 |
| Steam Rating | 80%+ Positive ("Very Positive") | Ongoing |

### 12.4 Press & Influencer Coverage

| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 Press Articles | 5+ (IGN, PC Gamer, Polygon, RPS, Eurogamer) | Pre-launch |
| Tier 2 Press Articles | 10+ (indie outlets, cross-industry) | Pre-launch + launch week |
| YouTube/Twitch Coverage | 20+ videos/streams | Launch week |
| Total Video Views | 100K+ views across all influencer content | Month 1 |

## 13. RISK MITIGATION — What Could Go Wrong

Marketing is predicting the future. The future is unknowable. Here is what to do when the plan fails.

### 13.1 Risk: Steam Wishlists Plateau Early

**Symptom**: Wishlists hit 10K and then stop growing, months before launch.

**Diagnosis**: Either the hook is not landing, or the target audience has been saturated.

**Solution**:
- A/B test the Steam short description. Try 3 different versions of the 30-second hook. See which converts better.
- Expand target audience. If TV sim players are tapped out, pivot to narrative game players. Emphasize the Notes System and the moral weight of decisions over the management sim mechanics.
- Double down on influencer outreach. One video from a larger creator (100K+ subs) can spike wishlists by 2K-5K overnight.

### 13.2 Risk: Demo Feedback is Negative

**Symptom**: Players try the Steam Next Fest demo and the feedback is "this is boring" or "I don't understand the appeal."

**Diagnosis**: Either the demo does not showcase the hook (the Notes System), or the core loop is not landing.

**Solution**:
- Revise the demo scope. If players are dropping off before they hit the Notes System, move the Notes System to the first 5 minutes instead of 15 minutes.
- Add an in-demo tutorial NPC (Richard Kessler or a mentor figure) who explains the stakes and the fantasy. "Your job is to decide what 20 million people watch. That script on your desk could be the next Sopranos. Or it could tank your career. What do you see?"
- If the core loop is fundamentally broken, delay the launch and fix it. A bad launch kills a game. A delayed launch is a setback.

### 13.3 Risk: Launch Reviews Are Mixed

**Symptom**: Week 1 Steam reviews are 65-70% positive (Mixed rating) instead of 80%+ (Very Positive).

**Diagnosis**: Either the game has critical bugs, or the audience expectations were misaligned.

**Solution**:
- If bugs: Patch immediately. Communicate transparently. "We are aware of [issue]. Patch 1.0.1 is live within 48 hours." Players forgive bugs if you fix them fast.
- If expectations: Read the negative reviews. What are they complaining about? If they say "this is too much reading," the marketing oversold the management sim angle and undersold the text-heavy nature. Adjust the store page copy to set correct expectations.
- If the game is polarizing (some players love it, some hate it): That is okay. Polarizing games have passionate fanbases. Lean into the fans. Feature their positive reviews. Build the community around the people who get it.

### 13.4 Risk: Influencer Coverage is Sparse

**Symptom**: You send 50 keys, get 5 videos.

**Diagnosis**: Either the game does not photograph well (hard to make compelling YouTube content), or the influencers were not the right fit.

**Solution**:
- Target different influencers. If Let's Players are not biting, try video essayists (Jacob Geller, Noah Caldwell-Gervais) who make long-form analysis content.
- Make a "creator guide" — a PDF that shows influencers the best moments to capture (the first greenlight decision, a creative dilemma with tough choices, the upfronts presentation, a show becoming a hit or a disaster). Make their job easier.
- Accept that some games are not YouTube-friendly. PILOT is a text-heavy, decision-driven sim. It is not a spectacle game. Lean into written press (articles, reviews, Twitter threads) over video content.

### 13.5 Risk: Sales Underperform Week 1

**Symptom**: 50K wishlists convert to 2K sales (4% conversion) instead of 5K (10%).

**Diagnosis**: Either the price is too high, or the launch timing was bad (competing releases), or the reviews scared off buyers.

**Solution**:
- If price: Offer a deeper launch discount (15-20% instead of 10%). The goal is to get players in the door. Revenue comes from long-tail sales.
- If timing: Extend the launch discount by 1 week. Market it as "Launch Week Extended."
- If reviews: Address the concerns in patch 1.0.1. Then market the patch. "We heard your feedback. Here's what we fixed."
- If none of the above: Accept that the market was smaller than projected. Recalibrate expectations. 2K sales is not a failure if the budget was controlled. Use the revenue to fund long-tail updates and a port to Switch (new audience, new sales spike).

## 15. CONCLUSION — THE MARKETING THESIS

**Marketing is not a phase. Marketing is a practice.**

You do not start marketing six weeks before launch. You start marketing the day you commit to the game. You build the audience in parallel with building the game. You make people care about PILOT before PILOT is playable.

**The hook is everything.**

PILOT is not "a management sim." PILOT is "the game where you decide what 20 million people watch, and your taste is the mechanic." The hook is the job fantasy, the creative terror, the moral weight of the greenlight button. Every tweet, every trailer, every press email must communicate that hook in five seconds or less.

**The audience is specific.**

Strategy sim players who are TV obsessives. Narrative game players who love industry settings. The TV industry professionals who lived this and will amplify it. Casual sim players drawn by the 2000s nostalgia. Know who you are talking to. Speak their language. Meet them where they live.

**Consistency beats virality.**

Post 3-4 times per week, every week, for 12 months. Build the habit. Build the audience. One viral tweet is luck. Fifty solid tweets over six months is strategy.

**Show the game, not the features.**

Do not say "robust development pipeline" and "dynamic industry simulation." Say "you read a script about a chemistry teacher who cooks meth. Do you greenlight it?" Show the player hovering between GREENLIGHT and KILL. Show the notes screen where every choice has weight. Show the game.

**Build the community before you need them.**

The players who wishlist at announcement are the players who defend you on Reddit when trolls appear. The Discord members who give feedback on the demo are the players who write Steam reviews on launch day. The TV writers who tweet about the game are the signal-boost that brings in thousands more. Invest in the community early. They are your marketing team.

**What gets made is up to you.**

That is the hook. That is the thesis. That is why this game matters.

Now go build the audience.

---

**End of Marketing Plan**

**Next Steps**:
1. Produce key art (commission illustrator, Week 1-4)
2. Draft announcement trailer script and storyboard (Week 5-6)
3. Set up social media accounts and Steam page (Week 7-8)
4. Begin press outreach (Month -8, announcement cycle)
5. Execute the timeline above, week by week, month by month, until launch

**Questions for Review**:
- Is the five-second hook strong enough? Does it stop the scroll?
- Is the target audience too narrow, or is specificity the strength?
- Is the 12-month timeline realistic for a small team, or does it need to be compressed?
- Should we prioritize influencer outreach over press, or vice versa?

**Approval**: This document is ready for stakeholder review and execution.

— HYPE, Marketing & Community Manager

**P.S.**: Start building the audience NOW. Not tomorrow. Not next week. NOW. The game that sold 200 copies because marketing started one month before launch haunts me every day. Do not let PILOT be that game.
