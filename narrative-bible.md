## I. THE WORLD'S WOUND

### Defining Event

Television broke open. Somewhere between 1999 and 2003, a medium that had spent fifty years as furniture -- the thing humming in the background of American life -- decided to become art. The Sopranos aired its first episode, and a chain reaction began that could not be stopped and could not be managed. What followed was a collision between the oldest business model in entertainment (sell eyeballs to advertisers, sell advertisers to shareholders) and the newest creative ambition (tell stories that rival literature, that rival cinema, that rival anything). The wound of this world is that collision. The wound is that greatness arrived inside a machine that was never built to hold it.

### Central Tension

Commerce versus art. But not the clean, philosophical version of that tension -- the ugly, daily, fluorescent-lit version. The version where a showrunner is crying in your office because you asked them to cut the scene that makes the pilot work but costs eight hundred thousand dollars. The version where you sit in a meeting and watch a room full of smart people convince themselves that what America wants is another forensic procedural, because the data says so, because the data always says so, because the data is a mirror that only shows you what you already are. The version where you greenlight something transcendent and it gets 3.2 million viewers and the network president looks at you like you've betrayed them personally.

The central tension is not between good shows and bad shows. It is between the show you believe in and the show you can survive.

### The Big Lie

The world believes that quality is measurable. That test audience scores, demographic data, comparable ratings analysis, and advertiser feedback can tell you whether a show is good. That the 18-49 demo share is a meaningful proxy for cultural worth. That if a show fails in the ratings, it was the wrong show -- not the wrong time, not the wrong slot, not the wrong audience.

The lie runs deeper: the industry believes that the gatekeeper's job is to predict. To look at a script, a showrunner, a cast, a concept, and know in advance whether it will work. But prediction is impossible. The gatekeeper's real job is to *choose* -- to decide what deserves a chance to exist, knowing that the outcome is unknowable. The lie of prediction protects executives from the existential weight of choice. If you are predicting, you can be right or wrong. If you are choosing, you are responsible.

### The World's Texture

What does this world smell like? It smells like toner and fresh coffee and the particular dry-clean chemical scent of a suit jacket that has been worn in too many conference rooms. It smells like the leather interior of a town car at 6 AM, driving to the lot. It smells like catering trays going stale in a development meeting that has run three hours long.

What does it sound like? The hum of fluorescent lights. The staccato percussion of a BlackBerry vibrating against a mahogany desk. Phones ringing -- always ringing. The performative laughter of a power lunch. The silence of a screening room at the moment a rough cut ends and everyone is waiting for someone else to speak first. The particular vocal register of an agent who is about to threaten you. The distant murmur of a writers' room down the hall, arguing about a second-act break.

What does it feel like? It feels like being important and precarious at the same time. Like every handshake is an audition. Like the city of Los Angeles itself is watching you, taking notes, ready to replace you with someone hungrier if you flinch. It feels like power -- real power, the power to determine what millions of people see -- housed inside a body that has not slept enough and cannot stop checking its phone.

## II. WORLD-BUILDING

### Geography: The Map of Power

**The Network Tower (Your Home Base)** -- A mid-rise building on the studio lot in Burbank or Century City, depending on which network the player inhabits. The executive floor is the 12th or 14th -- never the top, because the top belongs to the network president and the corporate parent. Your office has a window that faces west, toward the Pacific, and you can see the sun set behind the soundstages if you stay late enough, which you always do. The hallway carpet is the color of institutional ambition: teal, or burgundy, or that impossible grey-blue that only exists in corporate buildings. Development meetings happen in conference rooms named after the network's biggest hits from the '80s and '90s.

**The Screening Room** -- Down the hall from the executive offices. A small theater with maybe forty seats, though you are usually alone in it or with two or three colleagues. The seats are too comfortable. The darkness is total. This is where you watch rough cuts, and the quality of what you see here determines the quality of your sleep for the next week. The screening room is a confessional. There is nowhere to hide from what is on the screen.

**The Lot** -- Soundstages where your shows shoot, production offices where your showrunners work, the commissary where you eat lunch and pretend to be casual while the entire room is watching who sits with whom. The lot is a village, and villages have hierarchies, and yours is determined by how many shows you have in production and whether any of them are working.

**Upfronts Venues (New York)** -- Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Radio City Music Hall. Once a year, the networks cross the country to present their fall slates to advertisers and press. The upfronts are Broadway for television executives: a staged performance of confidence. You stand in the wings while the network president takes the stage. Your shows are announced with sizzle reels. The advertisers applaud politely or do not. The critics in the back row are already writing. The upfronts are the moment where everything you have built in private becomes public, irrevocable, real.

**Power Restaurants** -- The Ivy, Ago, the Palm, the Grill on the Alley. The booth you are seated in tells you where you stand. Against the wall, visible to the room: you matter. Near the kitchen: you used to matter. At the bar: you are on your way up or your way out, and only time will reveal which.

**The Agency Towers (CAA, WMA, ICM, Endeavor)** -- I.M. Pei's fortress in Century City for CAA. The William Morris building on El Camino. These are the talent armories. When your phone rings and the caller ID shows an agency prefix, your stomach tightens. Agents call to offer you something wonderful, to take something wonderful away, or to remind you that the talent you need belongs to them and the price just went up.

**The Trade Offices (Variety, The Hollywood Reporter)** -- Their reviews and scoops arrive like weather. A good review in Variety the morning after a premiere can shift the conversation around a show. A leaked story about development turmoil can kill a project before it shoots. The trades are the nervous system of the industry, and you read them the way a sailor reads the sky.

### The 2000s Television Landscape

The landscape is an ecosystem in upheaval. Broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, The WB, UPN) still command the largest audiences, but those audiences are shrinking season over season, and everyone can feel the floor tilting. Cable channels (HBO, FX, AMC, Showtime) are producing original scripted programming that is attracting the prestige, the awards, and the cultural conversation -- but not yet the mass viewership or the advertising revenue that sustains the broadcast model. The first tremors of what will become the streaming earthquake are years away, but the early signals are there: DVR adoption is changing how ratings are measured, DVD box-set sales are making serialized storytelling financially viable for the first time, and somewhere in Los Gatos, a company called Netflix is mailing red envelopes and thinking about what comes next.

The player enters this landscape in 2002 and navigates it through roughly 2008. During this window, the rules of television will change more than they changed in the previous three decades. The player's job is to navigate this transformation -- not from the outside, as an observer, but from inside the machine, as one of the people whose decisions determine whether the machine adapts or dies.

### Culture: The People Who Make This World

**Showrunners** are the auteurs of television, and in this era, they are becoming celebrities for the first time. A showrunner is the head writer and executive producer of a series -- the person who holds the creative vision. Some are reliable craftspeople who deliver on time, on budget, and at a consistent quality level. Some are volatile geniuses who produce transcendent work while burning through budgets, alienating actors, and having screaming arguments with network executives in parking lots. Your relationship with your showrunners is the most important relationship in the game. They need you to protect them from the business. You need them to deliver something worth protecting.

**Agents** are the brokers. They package talent -- writers, directors, actors -- and sell those packages to networks. An agent's loyalty is to their client, never to you, but a good agent-executive relationship is built on mutual dependability: you take their calls, you give honest reads, you don't waste their clients' time, and in return they bring you material before they bring it to your competitors. A bad agent relationship means you are always seeing scripts second.

**The Network President** is your boss and your ceiling. They answer to the corporate parent (a media conglomerate that cares about quarterly earnings, not art), and they manage the overall network brand, the advertising relationships, and the public face of the institution. The network president wants hits. They want stability. They want to stand at the upfronts and feel the room respond. Your relationship with the president determines your latitude. Deliver hits, and they give you room to take risks. Deliver failures, and the leash shortens until you can barely breathe.

**Critics** are the Greek chorus. They do not determine ratings, but they determine reputation. A show that critics love and audiences ignore becomes a cult object that haunts the executive who cancelled it. A show that audiences love and critics dismiss becomes a cash cow that nobody respects. The ideal -- the show that critics and audiences both embrace -- is the rarest thing in television and the thing every executive is hunting for.

**Advertisers** are the ones who actually pay for everything. They buy time slots based on projected viewership in specific demographics. They are conservative by nature -- they want to place ads in programming that will not embarrass their brands. A dark, morally complex drama about a methamphetamine manufacturer is, from an advertiser's perspective, a difficult environment in which to sell family sedans. The tension between what advertisers will support and what the culture is hungry for is one of the defining pressures of this era.

### Rules: How Television Development Works

The development cycle runs roughly as follows: In the late spring and summer, scripts are written and submitted to the networks. In the fall, networks select scripts for development and begin attaching showrunners, directors, and cast. In the winter and early spring, pilots are shot -- full episodes produced at considerable expense to serve as proof-of-concept. In May, the networks review their pilot crop, select which ones will go to series, and announce the fall schedule at the upfronts. Shows premiere in September. Ratings come in weekly. By November, the first cancellations begin. By January, the landscape has shifted, and the cycle begins again.

The player controls the development process from script selection through series order. They do not control production (that is the showrunner's domain) or scheduling (that is the network president's domain, though the player has influence). The player's power is curatorial and editorial: which scripts enter the pipeline, which talent is attached, and what notes shape the creative product.

### Secrets

The world has secrets the player discovers over time:

- The test audience system is broken. High test scores correlate with familiarity, not quality. The shows that test the best are the shows that remind audiences of what they have already seen. The shows that test the worst are often the ones that are trying to show them something new.
- The network president is under more pressure than they reveal. Corporate is considering selling the network, or merging it, or firing the president and replacing them with someone from the cable side. The president's desperation explains their contradictory behavior.
- One of the reliable showrunners -- the safe bet, the one who always delivers -- is privately miserable, creatively dead inside, and one bad note away from walking out of television entirely.
- The industry is smaller than it appears. Every burned relationship echoes for years. The showrunner you mistreat today is the showrunner your competitor hires tomorrow, and they remember everything.

## III. CHARACTERS

### 1. RICHARD KESSLER -- The Network President

**Role**: Your boss. The ceiling and the weather.

**Desire**: Richard wants to save the network. He wants to stand at the upfronts and hear applause and know that his schedule is a winner. He wants one more hit -- just one more -- to buy himself another two years in the job he has defined his entire life by.

**Need**: Richard needs to admit that the model he built his career on is dying. He needs to stop chasing the ghost of the last hit and start building for a television landscape that does not yet exist. He needs to trust someone -- anyone -- enough to let go of control.

**Wound**: Richard was a programming genius in the 1990s. He championed two of the decade's biggest hits. Then the world changed, and his instincts stopped working. He greenlit three expensive failures in a row, and the trades started writing about whether he had "lost the pulse." He has not recovered from the humiliation. Every decision he makes now is filtered through the terror of another public failure.

**Lie**: Richard believes that if he can just find the next big hit -- the one show that captures the culture -- everything will stabilize. The network will be safe, his job will be safe, his identity will be safe. He does not see that the problem is structural, not programmatic. No single hit can save a business model that is being dismantled by the tides of technology and culture.

**Arc**: Richard begins as an obstacle -- the voice demanding safety, punishing risk, forcing compromises. Over time, depending on the player's choices, he either evolves into an unlikely ally (if the player earns his trust by delivering results) or calcifies into a villain (if the player's risks embarrass him publicly). In his best arc, Richard's final act is one of genuine courage: putting his name and career behind a show he does not fully understand because he trusts the player who brought it to him. In his worst arc, he fires the player and replaces them with someone safe, and the retrospective narrator notes, with carefully calibrated sadness, that the network never recovered.

**Voice**: Richard speaks in the cadences of corporate reassurance -- smooth, warm, practiced. But when he is afraid, his language tightens. He becomes clipped and transactional. He repeats phrases like "what do the numbers say" and "we need to be smart about this" as mantras to ward off the chaos of creative uncertainty. When he is genuinely excited about something, his corporate voice drops entirely and he sounds twenty years younger, like the kid who fell in love with television in the first place.

**Gameplay Function**: Richard is the player's primary constraint. His approval or disapproval determines the player's budget, latitude, and job security. Managing Richard is the game's most important ongoing relationship -- not because he is the most interesting character, but because he is the one who can end the player's story. What does the player FEEL here? They feel the weight of answering to someone who is both powerful and afraid.

---

### 2. DIANE VALDEZ -- The Rival Executive

**Role**: VP of Development at the competing network. Your mirror and your nemesis.

**Desire**: Diane wants to build the most critically acclaimed slate in television. She wants to be the executive that history remembers as the one who saw the future first. She wants to win, and she defines winning as cultural impact, not just ratings.

**Need**: Diane needs to learn that building a legacy on the backs of other people's creative visions requires humility she does not yet possess. She needs to stop seeing showrunners as instruments of her ambition and start seeing them as collaborators with their own needs.

**Wound**: Diane was passed over for the network president job at her own network -- a job that went to a man with less experience and worse instincts, because the board wanted "a steady hand." She channels her fury into her development slate with an intensity that is either inspiring or terrifying, depending on who you ask and what day it is.

**Lie**: Diane believes that if her shows are good enough, the industry will have to acknowledge her. That quality is a weapon that cannot be defeated by politics. She does not see that her relentless pursuit of prestige is alienating the very talent she needs, because nobody wants to be a bullet in someone else's gun.

**Arc**: Diane is the player's rival, but she is not a villain. She is the player's distorted reflection -- what the player might become if they let ambition override empathy. Over the course of the game, Diane's slate produces shows of undeniable quality and shows of spectacular failure, because she swings hard and she swings often. Her arc intersects with the player's at key moments: a showrunner who has worked with both of them and must choose between their networks, an upfronts season where they are competing for the same advertising dollars, a moment late in the game where the industry is contracting and there may not be room for both of them. If the player and Diane develop a relationship of mutual respect, there is a late-game possibility of collaboration -- combining forces against the cable onslaught. If the relationship is purely antagonistic, Diane becomes the cautionary tale: brilliant, ambitious, and ultimately alone.

**Voice**: Diane speaks fast, with precision. She references specific episodes of specific shows to make her points -- "the cold open of episode seven, the one where the camera doesn't move for three minutes" -- because she watches everything and remembers everything. Her humor is dry and cutting. She compliments and threatens in the same sentence. She never raises her voice, because she was taught early that a woman who raises her voice in a network meeting gets called emotional, and she would rather die than be called emotional.

**Gameplay Function**: Diane is the competitive pressure. Her development choices are visible to the player -- the player sees what she is developing, what she has greenlit, what her network's identity is becoming. She forces the player to react: when Diane takes a risk that pays off, the player feels the pull to match her. When Diane makes a mistake, the player feels the temptation to exploit it. She is the mirror in which the player sees their own taste reflected and distorted.

### 3. TOMMY MORELL -- The Volatile Genius

**Role**: A showrunner of extraordinary talent and extraordinary difficulty. The high-risk, high-reward creative partner.

**Desire**: Tommy wants to make the show he sees in his head. He wants complete creative control. He wants to be left alone to write the thing he was born to write, without some executive in a suit telling him to add a love triangle.

**Need**: Tommy needs to learn that collaboration is not corruption. He needs to understand that an executive who pushes back on a creative choice is not always a philistine -- sometimes they are seeing something the creator cannot see because the creator is too close. Tommy needs to finish something. He has never completed a series run. Every show he has made has either been cancelled or imploded before it reached its natural ending.

**Wound**: Tommy's first show was a critical masterpiece that the network butchered in editing, re-ordered the episodes, burned off the final four in a Saturday-night death slot, and cancelled after one season. The show was later rediscovered on DVD and hailed as "ahead of its time." Tommy received none of the benefit and all of the damage. He does not trust network executives because the last ones destroyed the best thing he ever made.

**Lie**: Tommy believes that any creative compromise is a betrayal. That the only way to make great television is to fight every note, resist every suggestion, and protect the vision at all costs. He does not see that his absolutism is a form of cowardice -- it is easier to blame the suits for killing his work than to engage with the possibility that his work might be imperfect.

**Arc**: Tommy's arc is the game's most emotionally charged showrunner relationship. If the player gives Tommy's pilot thoughtful, intelligent notes -- notes that improve the work without violating the vision -- Tommy begins, slowly and grudgingly, to trust them. This trust is fragile. One bad note, one moment where the player caves to commercial pressure and forces a change Tommy considers a betrayal, and the relationship shatters. If the trust holds, Tommy produces a show that defines the player's network. If it breaks, Tommy walks, takes his show to Diane's network (or to cable), and the player has to watch someone else nurture the masterpiece they let go.

**Voice**: Tommy speaks in run-on sentences when he is excited, stacking metaphors on top of metaphors until the thought collapses under its own ambition and he has to start over. When he is angry, he goes quiet and monosyllabic, and the silence is worse than the shouting. He curses constantly but creatively -- the profanity is almost poetic. He references novels more than other television shows. He calls executives "suits" even when they are not wearing suits.

**Gameplay Function**: Tommy is the high-risk creative investment. Attaching Tommy to a project dramatically raises the quality ceiling and dramatically raises the difficulty of the development process. Every note the player gives on Tommy's project is higher-stakes than a normal note, because Tommy will react -- positively or negatively -- with an intensity that other showrunners do not match. Tommy is the test of the player's creative taste: can you make him better without making him less?

---

### 4. SANDRA OKONKWO -- The Reliable Master

**Role**: A showrunner of consistent excellence and quiet professionalism. The safe bet who is not as safe as she appears.

**Desire**: Sandra wants to keep working. She wants to deliver good shows that run for multiple seasons, that employ hundreds of people, that entertain millions. She wants stability, both creatively and financially.

**Need**: Sandra needs to take a risk. She has spent fifteen years delivering solid, well-crafted, professional television, and she has never made anything that surprised her. She has never written a scene that scared her. She needs to find out what happens when she stops being reliable and starts being dangerous.

**Wound**: Sandra was a staff writer on one of the great shows of the 1990s -- a show run by a famous showrunner who took all the credit and left Sandra's contributions unacknowledged. She learned two lessons: first, that she could do the work. Second, that visibility goes to the volatile, the loud, the difficult. She decided to be none of those things, and in exchange, she has had a career that is respected, well-compensated, and quietly invisible.

**Lie**: Sandra believes that reliability is enough. That if she keeps delivering solid work, the industry will value her appropriately. She does not see that the industry is changing, that the new landscape rewards boldness over consistency, and that her reliable procedurals are exactly the kind of television that history is about to leave behind.

**Arc**: Sandra's arc is a slow burn. In the early game, she is the safe choice -- the showrunner you attach to the project that needs to work, the one who will deliver a solid pilot on time and on budget. But as the game progresses, the player may notice signs of Sandra's restlessness: a line of dialogue in one of her scripts that is sharper and stranger than anything she has written before, a conversation where she asks the player, almost offhandedly, "Do you ever wonder what would happen if we just... didn't play it safe?" If the player encourages her -- gives her a project that demands risk, gives notes that push her toward the unfamiliar -- Sandra produces something that shocks everyone, including herself. If the player keeps using her as the safe bet, she delivers. And delivers. And delivers. And one day she leaves television entirely, and the retrospective narrator says, "She was the best showrunner most people never heard of."

**Voice**: Sandra speaks in complete, measured sentences. She does not interrupt. She asks clarifying questions before she responds. Her humor is warm and self-deprecating. She uses sports metaphors occasionally -- a habit she picked up from her father, who was a high school football coach. When she is excited about an idea, the only tell is that her sentences get slightly shorter, as if she is trying to keep the excitement contained.

**Gameplay Function**: Sandra is the player's anchor. She is the showrunner you can count on, the project that will not explode. She is also a hidden narrative opportunity -- the player who invests in Sandra's creative evolution unlocks one of the game's most rewarding arcs. She is the character who asks the player, without ever saying it directly: is your job to extract value from reliable people, or to help them become more than they thought they could be?

---

### 5. JOEL PFEIFFER -- The Agent

**Role**: A senior talent agent at the game's most powerful agency. The player's frenemy, enabler, and occasional tormentor.

**Desire**: Joel wants to close deals. He wants to package his clients into the most advantageous positions, extract the maximum value from every negotiation, and maintain his position at the top of the agency hierarchy. He wants to be the call that every executive takes on the first ring.

**Need**: Joel needs to remember why he got into the entertainment industry in the first place. Underneath the deal-making, Joel genuinely loves television -- but he has buried that love so deep beneath the transactional machinery of agenting that he can barely access it anymore. He needs a moment of genuine creative engagement to remind him that the work matters, not just the deal.

**Wound**: Joel was a playwright. He wrote two plays in his twenties that were produced off-Broadway and reviewed well. Then he ran out of money, took a job at an agency as a temporary measure, and discovered that he was extraordinarily good at it. Twenty years later, the plays sit in a drawer in his home office, and he has not written a sentence that was not a contract clause or a negotiation email since 1987.

**Lie**: Joel believes that the deal is the art. That packaging talent, negotiating terms, and engineering outcomes is a creative act equal to writing or directing. This is almost true -- Joel IS brilliant at what he does -- but the lie protects him from the grief of the creative life he abandoned.

**Arc**: Joel's arc is woven through the player's entire career. He is a constant presence -- calling with offers, calling with threats, calling to gossip, calling to negotiate. Over time, the player learns to read Joel's tells: when he is bluffing, when he is genuinely excited about a client's project, when he is packaging something mediocre with a good client to move inventory. If the player earns Joel's respect -- by having taste that Joel admires, by being honest when other executives dissemble -- Joel begins to drop the agent mask in private moments. He recommends scripts he loves, not just scripts he is selling. He shares industry intelligence he would normally hoard. In his most vulnerable moment, if the player has earned it, Joel admits that he misses writing, and the player has the option to respond with empathy or with the transactional indifference that the industry has taught both of them.

**Voice**: Joel speaks at a pace that suggests he is already three sentences ahead of you in the conversation. He uses first names constantly -- "Richard loves you, you know that, but Richard is nervous, and when Richard is nervous he makes bad decisions, and I don't want you to be one of Richard's bad decisions." He flatters and threatens simultaneously. He has a habit of quoting old movies in negotiations, as if the entire entertainment industry is one long scene they are all performing in. When he is being genuine, the performance drops and his voice gets quieter, and those moments are rare enough to be startling.

**Gameplay Function**: Joel is the player's primary interface with the talent marketplace. He controls access to the best showrunners, writers, directors, and actors. Managing Joel is a negotiation puzzle: he will always try to get more for his clients than the player's budget can support, but he will also bring the player opportunities that no one else is offering, if the relationship is strong enough. Joel is also the game's primary source of industry gossip and intelligence -- information that, if the player learns to interpret it correctly, provides strategic advantage.

---

### 6. MARTIN SCHEER -- The Critic

**Role**: The chief television critic at the game's equivalent of a major newspaper. The conscience of the medium.

**Desire**: Martin wants to matter. He wants his reviews to shape the conversation, to champion the worthy and bury the mediocre, to be the voice that history listens to when it asks, "What was good?"

**Need**: Martin needs to reckon with his own complicity. He is quick to condemn the networks for chasing ratings and compromising on quality, but he has never had to make a greenlight decision with a hundred jobs and a hundred million dollars at stake. He needs to understand the constraints he judges others for operating within.

**Wound**: Martin championed a show early in his career -- wrote a rapturous review, called it the future of the medium, went to war for it in print. The show was cancelled after six episodes. The executive who cancelled it told a reporter that Martin's review had actually hurt the show -- that it raised expectations to a level the ratings could never meet, and that the "critic's darling" label made advertisers nervous. Martin has never fully recovered from the suspicion that his advocacy destroyed the thing he loved.

**Lie**: Martin believes that criticism is objective. That quality is measurable by craft, ambition, and integrity, and that his assessments are free of the same commercial pressures that distort the executives' decisions. He does not see that his own biases -- toward a certain kind of white-male-antihero prestige drama, toward showrunners who flatter him with access, toward a definition of "quality" that excludes genres he considers beneath him -- are as limiting as any network executive's fear of risk.

**Arc**: Martin begins as a voice from outside the player's world -- his reviews appear as text events that affect the player's shows and reputation. Over time, the player develops a relationship with Martin, either through direct interaction (a dinner, a press event, a moment where the player champions a show that Martin also loves) or through the indirect language of creative choices (Martin notices when the player's slate is ambitious, and he notices when it is not). Martin's arc is about confronting his own limitations as a critic -- a confrontation that the player can either facilitate (by challenging Martin's assumptions in conversation) or avoid (by simply playing to his preferences). In the late game, Martin writes a retrospective piece about the player's network that serves as one of the game's evaluative lenses -- and the player discovers that Martin's assessment, however thoughtful, is incomplete. The player's legacy is bigger than any one critic's understanding of it.

**Voice**: Martin writes and speaks in the careful, slightly ornate prose of a newspaper critic who came up through the print tradition. His sentences are long and precisely constructed. He uses semicolons in conversation, somehow. He is capable of withering dismissal -- "the show has all the moral complexity of a fortune cookie" -- and of genuine, almost embarrassing passion -- "I watched the final scene three times and wept each time, and I am not ashamed." He does not use profanity, and this somehow makes him more intimidating than people who do.

**Gameplay Function**: Martin is the player's external evaluator. His reviews affect the cultural conversation around the player's shows, influencing talent perception and critical reputation (though not directly affecting ratings). Martin is also a strategic information source -- his observations about industry trends and competitor slates are often perceptive, and the player who reads between the lines of Martin's columns can gain strategic insight. But Martin's approval is a trap if pursued for its own sake: optimizing for Martin's taste produces a slate that is critically loved and commercially anemic.

## IV. TONE GUIDE

### Adjectives

**Warm. Pressurized. Bittersweet. Institutional. Intimate.**

The tone is warm the way a late-afternoon LA office is warm -- golden light on corporate surfaces, beauty imposed on sterility. It is pressurized the way a submarine is pressurized -- the tension is ambient, constant, and becomes invisible until something cracks. It is bittersweet because every victory in this world comes with a cost, and every failure carries within it the ghost of what might have been. It is institutional because the world is defined by its organizations -- networks, agencies, guilds -- and the individual struggles to exist inside those structures without being consumed by them. It is intimate because the decisions that define empires happen in small rooms between two people who are both pretending to be calmer than they are.

### Tone References

- **Mad Men** (television) -- The period texture, the institutional setting, the characters who are defined by their professional excellence and personal damage, the sense that an era is ending and everyone can feel it but no one can stop it.
- **Moneyball** (film) -- The tension between traditional instinct and new ways of seeing. The loneliness of the person who sees the future before anyone else. The scene where Brad Pitt sits alone in a dark stadium, listening to the game on the radio, unable to watch -- that is the feeling of waiting for your show's premiere ratings.
- **The Player** (Robert Altman, film) -- The Hollywood satire that is also a genuine thriller. The sense that the entertainment industry is a system that devours individuals while pretending to celebrate them. The moral ambiguity of every character, including the protagonist.
- **Pentiment** (game) -- The commitment to a specific historical period rendered with both intellectual rigor and emotional warmth. The sense that every choice the player makes ripples outward in ways they cannot fully predict.
- **Football Manager** (game) -- The management sim as existential experience. The "one more season" compulsion. The attachment to fictional people and the grief of losing them.
- **Difficult People** by Martin Amis (novel) -- The comedy of professional ambition, the way clever people destroy themselves in pursuit of status, the prose that is simultaneously brutal and empathetic.

### Dialogue Rules

Dialogue in PILOT is **professional-intimate**: the characters speak in the language of their industry, but the subtext is always personal. Nobody says what they mean directly. An agent saying "my client has other options" means "I am threatening you." A network president saying "I trust your judgment" means "I will hold you responsible for the outcome." A showrunner saying "I'm flexible on this" means "I have already decided, and I am giving you the illusion of input."

- Characters speak in complete thoughts. This is an industry of articulate people who use language as a tool.
- Humor is dry, observational, and slightly cruel. Nobody in this world is sentimental about their work in public; the sentimentality is private, buried, revealed only in unguarded moments.
- Industry jargon is used naturally but always in context. The player learns the vocabulary by hearing it deployed, never by having it explained. "We need to see a bump in the 18-49" is never glossed. The player figures it out.
- Silence is a weapon. The most powerful moments in dialogue are the pauses -- the beat after a note is given, the beat before a verdict is delivered, the beat where someone decides whether to tell the truth.

### What This World Is NOT

- **It is not a satire.** The world of PILOT takes itself seriously because the people in it take themselves seriously. They are allowed to be absurd -- a three-hour meeting about whether a pilot's title works -- but the absurdity is presented without winking. The player is inside the world, not above it.
- **It is not cynical.** The game does not believe that all television executives are soulless or that commerce inevitably destroys art. The game believes that the tension between commerce and art is where the interesting decisions happen, and that the people who navigate that tension deserve empathy, not contempt.
- **It is not nostalgic.** The 2000s setting is not deployed for warm fuzzy feelings about flip phones and The O.C. The era is chosen because it is dramatically rich -- a moment of genuine transformation where the stakes were real and the outcome was uncertain. The game treats the period with the seriousness of a historical drama, not the fondness of a clip show.
- **It is not prestige-fetishistic.** The game does not believe that dark, serialized, morally complex dramas are inherently superior to well-crafted procedurals, broad comedies, or genre entertainment. The player who builds a network of excellent populist programming is not playing the game "wrong." The game asks what the player values, and it respects every answer.
- **It is not mean.** The characters are complicated, sometimes selfish, sometimes cowardly, sometimes brilliant, sometimes wrong. They are never cartoons. Even the most antagonistic character in the game has a reason for being the way they are, and the game trusts the player to see it.

### Sample Passages

**Passage 1: A Screening Room Moment**

The rough cut ends. The screen goes dark. You sit in the screening room for a long time. The pilot is -- you are not sure what it is. The first fifteen minutes are extraordinary: a sustained sequence of tension and dark comedy that feels like nothing else on your network, nothing else on anyone's network. The last twenty minutes lose the thread. The showrunner is trying to do too much, cramming a season's worth of character development into the back half of the pilot because she is afraid she will not get a second episode to say what she needs to say. The test audience data will be terrible. The ad sales team will have concerns. Richard will ask you what you're thinking, and what you are thinking is: this is broken and this is brilliant and I do not know if those are two separate things.

You pick up the legal pad from the armrest. You start writing notes.

**Passage 2: A Phone Call from Joel**

The BlackBerry buzzes at 7:14 AM. Joel Pfeiffer. You know it is Joel because Joel is the only person who calls before eight and after midnight.

"I have something," he says, which is how Joel starts every call, the way some people start with hello. "My client -- you know who I mean, don't make me say the name on an open line like we're in a spy movie -- my client has a new project. Cable wants it. Your friend Diane wants it. Everybody wants it. But my client wants to do broadcast, because my client is, in my professional opinion, slightly insane, and also because my client believes that twenty million viewers is better than four million, which, I have to say, is not an indefensible position." A pause. "You have until Thursday. Read the script. If you don't love it, tell me you don't love it, and we stay friends. If you love it, then we talk numbers, and I warn you, the numbers are going to make your eyes water."

He hangs up. He always hangs up before you can respond. You have learned not to take it personally.

**Passage 3: The Upfronts**

The lights in Carnegie Hall dim, and Richard Kessler walks out to a podium and a teleprompter and six hundred people who are about to decide whether your network lives or dies. Not literally. Literally, they are deciding how many advertising dollars to commit to your fall schedule. But it feels literal. Richard smiles. Richard always smiles. Richard could smile through an earthquake.

"This fall," he says, "we're bringing you a lineup that we believe represents the best of what television can be."

Behind the curtain, you watch the sizzle reel for your most ambitious greenlight play on a monitor. The show looks good. You think the show looks good. You have told everyone the show looks good. In three minutes, six hundred advertisers will see it, and if the room is silent, you will know. And if the room applauds, you will know. And either way, you will have to live with what you put on that stage.

## V. NARRATIVE-MECHANIC INTEGRATION

*Every mechanic tells a story. Here is what each one tells.*

### The Notes System Tells a Story About Compromise

The Notes System is the soul of PILOT, and its narrative function is to externalize the internal experience of creative compromise. Every note the player gives is a micro-narrative of its own: a creative vision (the showrunner's intention) collides with a practical concern (budget, audience, network identity), and the player must choose how to resolve the collision. The note is not a stat adjustment -- it is a moral choice disguised as a creative one.

When the player gives a note that improves commercial viability at the cost of creative ambition, the game is telling a story about what the player is willing to sacrifice for survival. When the player protects a bold creative choice at the cost of commercial safety, the game is telling a story about what the player is willing to risk for art. The accumulation of these choices -- dozens of notes across dozens of pilots across multiple seasons -- creates a narrative portrait of the player's values that is more honest than any dialogue choice or branching path could ever be.

What does the player FEEL here? They feel the weight of each individual compromise. They feel the distance between the show that exists in their head and the show that exists on screen. They feel the specific sting of giving a note they know is wrong because the business demands it, and the specific thrill of protecting a choice they believe in against all opposition.

### Network Identity Reflects the Player's Soul

The Network Identity system is not a brand strategy tool -- it is a mirror. As the player's decisions accumulate across axes (Prestige vs. Populist, Risk-Taking vs. Safe, Auteur-Driven vs. Producer-Driven), the network's identity becomes a visible portrait of the player's taste, values, and compromises. The player looks at their network profile and sees themselves reflected back.

This creates a narrative that no authored story could achieve: the story of self-recognition. The player who intended to build a bold, risk-taking prestige network discovers, three seasons in, that their identity profile shows a drift toward safety -- and that drift happened one note at a time, one compromise at a time, without them ever making a conscious decision to change course. The system tells the story of how institutions shape individuals, how the pressure of survival erodes intention, how the gap between who you want to be and who you are is measured in a thousand small decisions you barely noticed making.

### The Landscape Creates Dramatic Irony

The television industry simulation that surrounds the player creates a persistent state of dramatic irony: the player knows (or suspects, if they are a student of TV history) what is coming, but the characters do not. The player knows that serialized dramas will eventually dominate the medium. The player knows that cable will steal the cultural conversation. The player may know that the writers' strike is coming, that streaming is coming, that the broadcast model is in terminal decline. But the characters are living inside the moment, and their decisions are shaped by the information and assumptions of their present.

This irony is not a gimmick -- it is the emotional engine of the late game. The player's foreknowledge becomes a burden. Knowing what is coming does not make the decisions easier; it makes them harder, because the player can see the consequences more clearly than anyone around them, and still has to operate within a system that does not share their vision. What does the player FEEL here? They feel the loneliness of seeing further than the room. They feel the temptation to exploit their knowledge and the guilt of doing so. They feel the strange grief of watching a world change in ways that are, from a historical distance, inevitable, but that are, from inside the moment, devastating.

### Environmental Storytelling in the Office

The player's desk is not a UI -- it is a narrative environment. The objects on the desk tell a story:

- **The script pile** grows and shrinks with the development cycle, and its height is a visual indicator of pressure. During peak pilot season, the desk is buried. During the summer lull, it is almost empty, and the emptiness feels wrong.
- **Post-it notes** accumulate with reminders from the player's choices: "Call Tommy back," "Sandra's pilot -- budget review Thurs," "Joel -- Thursday deadline." They are the residue of the player's commitments, and their density tells the story of how many plates the player is spinning.
- **Trade magazines** arrive on the desk with headlines that reflect the game state. The player sees their own decisions narrated back to them in the language of industry journalism, and the disconnect between how a decision felt from the inside and how it reads in the trades is its own kind of storytelling.
- **The view from the window** changes subtly with the seasons and with the player's status. An executive on the rise gets a better office with a better view. An executive in decline loses the window.
- **Personal objects** -- a framed photo, a memento, an old script -- remain constant, quiet reminders that the player character has a life beyond the decisions, even if the game rarely shows it.

## VI. LORE HIERARCHY

### Need-to-Know (The Player Must Understand This to Play)

- You are a VP of Development at a broadcast television network in the early 2000s.
- Your job is to find, develop, and shepherd pilot scripts into television series.
- The development cycle: scripts arrive, you select, develop, attach talent, give notes, shoot pilots, decide what goes to series, present at upfronts, launch shows, receive ratings.
- Your boss (the network president) wants hits. Your creative partners (showrunners) want freedom. Your business partners (advertisers) want safety. You are the fulcrum.
- The television industry is changing. Cable is rising. Audiences are fragmenting. The old rules are becoming unreliable.

### Want-to-Know (Enriches the Experience for Curious Players)

- The specific dynamics of the 2000s TV landscape: why cable could take creative risks that broadcast could not (no advertisers to offend, subscription model), why the DVD market changed storytelling (serialized shows sold box sets), why the 18-49 demographic became the only number that mattered.
- The personal histories of the major characters -- Richard's failures in the late '90s, Diane's passed-over promotion, Tommy's destroyed masterpiece, Sandra's invisible contributions, Joel's abandoned playwriting career, Martin's show that he championed to death.
- The mechanics of how test audiences work and why they are unreliable. The politics of time slot scheduling. The economics of pilot production. The rituals of the upfronts.
- The rival networks' strategies and how they reflect different philosophies of what television should be.

### Deep Lore (Rewards Dedicated Players and Lore Hunters)

- The full history of the fictional network -- its founding, its golden era, its decline, the specific shows that defined each period. Old show titles that appear on conference room nameplates. A trophy case in the lobby with Emmy statuettes from decades past.
- The interconnected histories of the showrunners: who worked together, who mentored whom, which writers' room grudges from the '90s still echo in the 2000s development landscape.
- Joel Pfeiffer's plays. They exist as text objects hidden deep in the game -- two short plays, written in the voice of a young man who loved theater, discoverable only if the player earns Joel's deepest trust.
- The full text of Martin Scheer's review that killed the show he loved. It is beautiful criticism. It is also, reading it now, obviously the work of a man who was more in love with his own prose than with the show he was reviewing.
- A chart in the network's archive room showing every show the network has ever aired, its ratings, and its run length. The chart tells a story about the network's identity over decades -- and hidden in the data is the pattern that explains why the network is in its current crisis.

### Never-Told (Exists for Internal Consistency)

- The corporate parent's complete financial situation and board dynamics. We know the parent is pressuring Richard, but the specifics of the corporate politics are never fully revealed, because the player -- like a real VP of Development -- does not have access to that level of information. The uncertainty is the point.
- The complete creative content of the fictional shows. The player sees excerpts, rough cuts, and reviews, but never full episodes. The shows exist in the imagination, in the gap between what the game describes and what the player envisions. This is deliberate: the player's mental image of their shows is always better (or worse) than anything the game could render, and that gap is where the emotional investment lives.
- The futures of the characters after the game's timeline ends. Does Richard survive? Does Diane get her network presidency? Does Tommy finish a show? Does Sandra take her risk? These questions are left open because the game is about the moment of decision, not the outcome.
- The player character's full backstory. Where they came from, what they did before, who they are outside the office. The player character is deliberately underdefined because the player IS the character, and their taste is their biography.

## VII. TIMELINE OF THE GOLDEN AGE

### 2002 -- The Inheritance (Game Start)

The player inherits a development slate from their predecessor: aging procedurals, a few modest hits, a cupboard full of safe bets. The industry context: The Sopranos has been airing for three years and has rewritten the rules of what television can be, but that rewriting has happened on HBO, not on broadcast. The broadcast networks are still chasing the ER/Friends/CSI model. The tension between what television IS becoming (on cable) and what the broadcast networks are still trying to be (a mass-audience advertising platform) is the central strategic challenge. The player must decide, from day one, which side of history to build for.

### 2003 -- The Fracture

The landscape cracks open. A wave of ambitious, serialized, tonally dark programming begins to emerge across the dial -- some of it on broadcast, most of it on cable. The player begins to feel the gravitational pull of the new model. Meanwhile, reality television is exploding (Survivor, American Idol), offering broadcast networks a cheap, high-rated alternative to expensive scripted programming. The temptation to lean into reality is a strategic trap: it solves the short-term ratings problem while accelerating the long-term creative decline. Industry event: a rival network launches a reality hit that dominates the ratings, forcing every other network to respond.

### 2004 -- The Bet

The year the player's early choices begin to bear fruit or rot. Shows greenlit in 2002-03 are now in their second or third seasons, and their trajectories are becoming clear. The industry is beginning to recognize that the old development model (produce twelve pilots, pick five, cancel three by November) is wasteful and risk-averse. Cable networks are producing fewer shows with longer development cycles and better results. The player must decide whether to adopt the cable model within a broadcast framework -- a risky bet that could modernize their network or starve it of content. Industry event: a broadcast network launches a serialized, mythology-heavy drama that becomes a massive hit, proving that broadcast audiences will watch complex television -- if the execution is right.

### 2005 -- The Peak

The golden age is in full bloom. The player's network either has a seat at the table or is watching the table from across the room. Cable dramas are winning Emmys and dominating the cultural conversation. DVD box set sales are funding ambitious storytelling. The economic model is, briefly, in harmony with the creative ambition. But the harmony is fragile. Industry event: DVR penetration reaches a tipping point, and the networks begin fighting over how to count time-shifted viewers. The advertising model trembles.

### 2006 -- The Reckoning

The first wave of cancellations hits -- not individual shows, but the cancellation of an entire approach to programming. Networks that bet on the old model are hemorrhaging viewers. Networks that bet on the new model are hemorrhaging advertisers. The player is squeezed from both directions. Richard is under increasing pressure from the corporate parent. Diane is making bolder swings. The creative community is restless, sensing that the balance of power is shifting from networks to talent. Industry event: a critically acclaimed show on a basic cable network breaks out commercially, proving that cable can compete with broadcast on scale, not just quality. The ground shifts.

### 2007 -- The Strike

The Writers Guild of America goes on strike in November 2007, shutting down Hollywood. The strike is, on its surface, about residuals for digital distribution -- about who gets paid when shows are sold online, a market that barely exists yet. But beneath the surface, the strike is about the future of the medium: who owns the value of creative work in a digital world? The strike shuts down production. Shows go on hiatus. Development pipelines freeze. The player's carefully built slate is disrupted. But the strike is also a moment of clarity: with no new scripts coming in, the player must confront what they already have, and what it means. The silence of the strike is a mirror. Industry event: the strike lasts 100 days and changes the power dynamics of the industry permanently.

### 2008 -- The Aftermath (Game Conclusion)

The strike ends. The industry resumes. But nothing is the same. The development pipeline that was disrupted by the strike is now being reshaped by the early effects of the recession and the first serious incursions of digital distribution. The player navigates a final season in a landscape that is recognizably different from the one they entered in 2002. The old broadcast model is not dead, but it is clearly dying. The cable model is ascendant. Somewhere in the distance, streaming is approaching.

The game ends not with a victory screen but with a retrospective. A voice -- the "prestige television historian" referenced in the pitch -- narrates the story of the player's tenure. The shows they greenlit. The shows they killed. The notes they gave. The risks they took and the risks they avoided. The showrunners they championed and the ones they failed. The voice is measured, thoughtful, and unflinching. It does not judge the player. It simply tells the story of what they did, and the player must sit with it.

What does the player FEEL here? They feel the weight of a body of work. They feel the distance between who they intended to be and who they were. They feel the particular bittersweet ache of looking back at a period of your life that was difficult and meaningful and is now, irrevocably, over.

They feel like they have lived inside the golden age of television. And they feel like it is time to turn off the lights, leave the office, and drive home through the LA dark, the city glittering below them, and wonder what comes next.

*"The story of PILOT is not a story that we write. It is a story that the player writes, note by note, compromise by compromise, greenlight by greenlight. Our job is to build a world vivid enough that the player's choices feel like they matter -- not because the game tells them they matter, but because the player cares. The characters must feel like real people. The dilemmas must feel like real dilemmas. The era must feel like a place you could walk into and smell the coffee and hear the phones. If we do our job right, the player will finish a season and sit quietly for a moment, thinking about what they did, and why, and whether they are proud of it. That silence is the story. That silence is everything."*
