# PILOT — Game Pitch Document

**Game Dev Story meets Mad Men**

*A television development sim where your taste is the mechanic, every greenlight is a gamble, and the golden age of TV is yours to build — or botch.*

---

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**You're the network exec who decides what America watches — in the decade when television became art, and every wrong call could end your career.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "I killed the greatest show never made because I was scared of the ratings. Then I gave its time slot to a cop procedural that ran for nine seasons. I still think about it."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

Picture this: A script lands on your desk. The coverage reader's notes say it's "unmarketable" — serialized, ensemble cast, morally grey, no clear hero. The showrunner attached is a volatile genius fresh off a critical darling that got 3 million viewers. The network president wants another CSI clone. Your competitor just poached your top drama producer. You read the pilot script. The writing is on fire. The concept is ahead of its time.

You greenlight it. You fight for a 13-episode order instead of 22. You push back on the network note to add a love triangle. You shield the showrunner from the upfronts committee. You cast the unknown actor everyone else passed on. The pilot shoots. You watch the rough cut.

It's a masterpiece.

The test audience scores come in: 42 out of 100. The ad sales team says they can't sell it. The network president calls you into his office.

What do you do?

THAT is the GIF. Not an explosion. Not a combo chain. A player staring at a screen full of contradictory information — a brilliant show that nobody wants — and the GREENLIGHT and KILL buttons glowing on either side. The cursor hovering. The hesitation. That moment is television. That moment is the game.

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Loop

What's the loop? Let me walk it.

**30-second loop**: Read coverage on an incoming script. Scan the logline, the reader's grade, the genre tag, the talent attachments. Make a gut call — PASS, CONSIDER, or PRIORITY. Every script that hits your desk has a ticking clock; leave it in the pile too long and another network grabs it. The feel here is a card-evaluation game: rapid triage under information scarcity. You never have enough time to read everything deeply, so your instincts matter as much as your analysis.

**5-minute loop**: Develop a pilot. You've prioritized a script. Now you're in the development pipeline: attach a showrunner (each has stats, tendencies, ego levels, and creative visions that may clash with the material), negotiate casting (the perfect actor wants too much money; the affordable actor is wrong for the role but the showrunner loves them), give creative notes on the script (each note is a push-pull between creative integrity and commercial viability), and manage your development budget across 8-12 simultaneous projects. Every decision you make changes the pilot's DNA — its quality ceiling, its commercial floor, its identity.

**Session loop (45-90 minutes)**: One development season. You shepherd 8-12 pilots from script to screen, but only 3-5 will go to series. The season climaxes at the UPFRONTS — the annual presentation where you reveal your slate to advertisers. Before that, you watch rough cuts, review test audience data, field calls from talent agents threatening to walk, manage your relationships with the network president and the creative community, and make the final kill/series decisions. After the upfronts, your shows launch. Ratings come in week by week. Some hit. Some die. Your reputation updates. Your budget for next season adjusts. The industry landscape shifts. New scripts arrive.

How does this feel at hour 20? At hour 20, you're not reading coverage anymore — you're reading the *industry*. You know that serialized dramas are trending upward but the ad market hasn't caught up yet. You know that showrunner X delivers on time but plays it safe, while showrunner Y is a nightmare to manage but might make something transcendent. You've developed an *aesthetic identity* for your network — and now the game is about whether you double down on that identity or chase the trend. The early game is about picking good scripts. The mid-game is about building a slate. The late game is about defining an era.

### Core Mechanics

1. **Script Triage / The Desk**: Your desk is the hub. Scripts arrive as physical documents with coverage sheets — a logline, a genre tag, a reader's grade (C+ through A), and blind-spot indicators that tell you what the coverage MIGHT be missing. You can deep-read a script (costs time, reveals hidden qualities and flaws), skim it (fast, surface-level info only), or trust the coverage entirely. The tension: deep-reading everything means you miss new submissions. Skimming means you might greenlight a mediocrity or kill a masterpiece. The desk is an information-management puzzle wrapped in a time-pressure game.

2. **The Development Pipeline**: Once a script is prioritized, it enters development. This is the strategic core — a multi-variable optimization problem disguised as Hollywood deal-making. You assign a showrunner (each with a creative profile that meshes or clashes with the material), negotiate cast attachments (budget vs. star power vs. artistic fit), allocate production budget (a cheap pilot looks cheap; an expensive pilot raises the stakes if it fails), and give NOTES. Notes are the key verb. Every note you give nudges the pilot along spectrums: commercial vs. auteur, accessible vs. challenging, safe vs. risky. Give too many commercial notes and the creative team resents you, the show becomes generic, and critics ignore it. Give too few and the show might be brilliant but unmarketable. The development pipeline is where your TASTE becomes a mechanical input.

3. **The Notes System**: This deserves its own section because it's the soul of the game. When you give notes on a pilot, you're presented with specific creative decisions — not abstract sliders, but concrete choices. "The showrunner wants the protagonist to be an antihero who never gets redemption. Do you push for a redemption arc in the finale?" "The pilot script opens with a 10-minute single-take that's technically ambitious but will cost $800K. Do you protect it or ask for coverage?" "The test audience hated the non-linear structure. Do you mandate a linear re-edit?" Each note has cascading consequences on quality, commercial viability, creative team morale, and your reputation in the industry. The mastery is learning which battles to fight and which to concede.

4. **Network Identity / The Brand**: Over multiple seasons, your decisions accumulate into a network identity — a visible profile that tracks where you sit on axes like Prestige vs. Populist, Risk-Taking vs. Safe, Auteur-Driven vs. Producer-Driven. This identity isn't cosmetic. It affects which showrunners want to work with you, which scripts you get first-look deals on, how advertisers value your slots, and how critics frame your shows. A network known for bold swings attracts better creative talent but scares advertisers. A network known for reliable hits prints money but bleeds cultural relevance. Your brand is your strategy, and it emerges organically from hundreds of small decisions.

5. **The Landscape / Industry Simulation**: The television industry around you is alive and evolving. Competing networks are developing their own slates. Cable channels are experimenting with shorter seasons and darker content. Audience habits are shifting — serialized dramas are gaining prestige but losing casual viewers. Technology is changing (DVR adoption means time-shifted viewing matters). Real historical inflection points arrive as events: a show on a rival network breaks out and redefines what's possible, forcing everyone to react. The landscape is the macro-strategy layer — you're not just picking good shows, you're positioning your network in a shifting ecosystem.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner picks the scripts with the highest coverage grades, attaches the most famous showrunners, gives notes that chase test audience approval, and gets a slate of competent, forgettable shows that perform adequately.

An expert reads the landscape three seasons ahead. They identify a genre shift before it peaks, develop material that will be culturally resonant when it airs (not when it's greenlit), cultivate relationships with emerging showrunners who haven't hit yet, give notes that protect the creative vision while making surgical commercial concessions, and build a network brand so distinct that talent seeks them out. The expert's slate has one or two transformative shows, two reliable performers, and a bold swing that might fail spectacularly but defines the conversation. They understand that their job isn't to pick winners — it's to *create the conditions where greatness can happen*.

Where's the depth? It's in the interplay between systems. The script that looks mediocre on paper but has a showrunner who elevates everything. The expensive cast attachment that raises the pilot's floor but caps its ceiling because the actor won't do morally complex material. The network president who wants a hit NOW versus the three-season play that builds a brand. Every decision ripples. Mastery is reading the ripples.

### Unique Mechanic

**The Notes System** — the idea that your creative feedback on a pilot is the primary gameplay verb, and that those notes have mechanical weight. No other management sim puts you inside the *editorial conversation*. You're not just allocating resources or picking winners from a list. You're shaping the creative work itself, note by note, compromise by compromise. You feel the tension between commerce and art in every click. This is the mechanic that separates PILOT from every other tycoon game: you don't just decide WHAT gets made — you decide what it BECOMES.

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**Beneath the spreadsheets and the deal-making, this game is about the cost of taste.**

What does the player FEEL here? They feel the weight of being the person who stands between a creative vision and an audience. The gatekeeper. The filter. The game asks: what happens to you when your job is to decide what's good? When every greenlight is an act of faith and every cancellation is a small death? When the thing you love most might be the thing that destroys your career?

Every mechanic tells a story. The Notes System isn't about optimizing a product — it's about the moral injury of compromise. Every note you give is a tiny betrayal of someone's vision or a tiny betrayal of your audience's trust. The Network Identity system isn't about brand strategy — it's about whether you can look at the body of work you've enabled and feel proud. The Landscape isn't about market analysis — it's about the terror of irrelevance, the feeling that the world is changing and you might be on the wrong side of history.

The theme is: **Is it possible to be a gatekeeper and still have a soul?**

### The World

The world of PILOT is the television industry of the early-to-mid 2000s, and it is a world mid-earthquake.

The texture: fluorescent-lit offices with scripts piled on every surface. Development meetings in conference rooms with whiteboards covered in show titles and time slot grids. Power lunches at restaurants where the booth you sit in signals your status. Screening rooms where you watch rough cuts alone, a legal pad on your knee, trying to figure out if the thing you're watching is brilliant or broken. The upfronts at Carnegie Hall, where a network president stands before hundreds of advertisers and sells hope. The phone calls — endless phone calls — from agents, showrunners, talent, your boss, your rival, your conscience.

The wound of this world is **the collision between art and commerce at the exact moment when that collision produced something unprecedented**. This is the era when The Sopranos proved that television could stand beside cinema. When The Wire was airing to 4 million viewers and being called the greatest novel ever written for screen. When Lost proved that 20 million people would watch a serialized mystery. When Arrested Development was the best comedy on television and nobody watched it. When Deadwood was cancelled to make room for something cheaper. When network executives were simultaneously presiding over the greatest creative boom in the medium's history and desperately trying to protect a business model that was already dying.

Where does the world crack? It cracks in the space between what you know is good and what you know will rate. It cracks when you sit in a screening room and watch something extraordinary and then walk into a meeting where the conversation is about 18-49 demo shares. It cracks when a showrunner you respect looks at you and asks, "Do you actually believe in this show?" and you have to decide whether to lie. It cracks when you cancel something beautiful because the business demands it, and you tell yourself it's just business, and you know it's not.

The aesthetic is warm analog grain. Physical scripts with coffee stains. Office decor that's trying too hard to be tasteful. The particular institutional carpet and drop-ceiling lighting of a media company office in 2004. Cell phones that flip open. BlackBerries buzzing during screenings. The LA sun hitting tinted office windows. Trade magazines — Variety, The Hollywood Reporter — arriving in physical editions with headlines that might contain your name or your failure. Everything feels simultaneously glamorous and fluorescent, important and absurd.

### Player's Emotional Arc

**First season**: Excitement and overwhelm. So many scripts, so many possibilities. You greenlight based on gut feel and obvious quality. Some shows work, most don't. You feel the thrill of the hit and the sting of the flop. You are learning the vocabulary.

**Seasons 2-3**: Growing confidence, growing attachment. You've developed a sense of your own taste. You've found showrunners you trust. You start taking creative risks — not because the game rewards them, but because you've started to care about the WORK, not just the ratings. You cancel a show you love because it's dying, and it hurts in a way a management sim shouldn't.

**Seasons 4-6**: The golden age, or the crisis. Your network is either ascending toward cultural relevance or drowning in mediocrity, and you can feel which way it's going. The decisions get harder because the stakes are personal. You've built something — a slate, a brand, a reputation — and now you have to decide whether to protect it or risk it. The landscape is shifting. Cable is ascendant. Your comfortable procedural money-makers are aging. Do you chase the new or ride the old until it dies?

**Late game**: Legacy. What does the player FEEL here? They feel the weight of a body of work. The shows they greenlit, the shows they killed, the notes they gave, the compromises they made. The game's final evaluation isn't a score — it's a retrospective. A "prestige television historian" narrator looks back at your network's run and tells the story of what you built. And the player has to sit with whether they're proud of it. The emotional destination isn't victory. It's **reckoning**.

### The Story Hook

**It's 2002. You've just been promoted to VP of Development at a broadcast network that's bleeding viewers to cable.**

Your predecessor left behind a slate of aging procedurals and a development cupboard full of safe bets. The network president — charming, political, terrified — tells you the same thing at every meeting: "We need a hit." What they mean is: we need a hit that looks like the last hit. What they don't say is: the last hit is why we're dying.

Your first week, three scripts cross your desk. One is a procedural that's basically CSI with a twist — reliable, castable, boring. One is an ambitious serialized drama from a first-time showrunner that could be the next Sopranos or the next $5 million mistake. One is a workplace comedy that's genuinely funny but has no obvious time slot.

You have budget for two.

This is the opening move of PILOT, and it contains the entire game in miniature: taste versus safety, vision versus viability, the show you believe in versus the show that might save your job. The player's choices in this first development cycle set the trajectory of everything that follows — not because they're mechanically binding, but because they establish the player's *relationship with their own taste*. And that relationship is the real story.

As seasons progress, the narrative layer deepens. Showrunners return with new projects — and memories of how you treated their last one. Actors you discovered become stars who now have demands. The industry events that arrive aren't random — they're the actual seismic shifts of the era: the Sopranos finale that changes what endings can be, the rise of basic cable original programming, the first whispers of streaming, the writers' strike of 2007-08 that shutters Hollywood and forces everyone to confront what television is FOR. The player navigates these as both strategic challenges and emotional turning points. The story of PILOT is the story of American television's transformation — told through the eyes of the person who had to make the bet.

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary**: Strategy and management sim players aged 25-45 who are also TV obsessives. They've played Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, or Megaquarium and wished the decisions felt more personal. They watch prestige TV, they have opinions about network scheduling, they've read Alan Sepinwall's books, they listen to The Watch or The Ringer's TV podcasts. They are the people who argue about whether The Wire or The Sopranos is the greatest show ever made. They live on Reddit TV communities, TV Twitter, and Letterboxd (increasingly for TV logging). They want a game that respects their knowledge of the medium.

**Secondary**: Narrative game players who love Hollywood/entertainment industry settings. They played Disco Elysium for the writing, they loved The Beginner's Guide, they played through every route in Pentiment. They're drawn to games about creative work and the politics of art. The Notes System and the narrative layer give them an in even if they don't typically play management sims.

**Tertiary**: Casual management sim players who bounce between Game Dev Story on their phone and Planet Coaster on Steam. The TV setting is a fresh hook and the 2000s nostalgia (for players who grew up in that era) is an evergreen draw. They'll find the game through "recommended if you liked" algorithms.

**Secret weapon audience**: TV industry professionals. Showrunners, writers' room staffers, development executives, agents — the people who LIVED this. They'll play it, tweet about it, argue about its accuracy, and generate organic buzz that money cannot buy. What's the hook in 5 seconds? "There's a game where you play a TV exec and it's actually good." That sentence gets retweeted by every TV writer on the internet.

### Comparable Games

1. **Game Dev Story / Game Dev Tycoon** — The direct mechanical ancestor. A development sim where you shepherd creative products from concept to release. PILOT replaces the abstracted quality scores with deep creative engagement (the Notes System) and replaces the tech industry setting with a world that's inherently more dramatic, political, and emotionally charged.

2. **Hardspace: Shipbreaker** meets **Mad Men** — This sounds strange but hear me out. Shipbreaker is a game about doing a complex, demanding job and finding meaning in the craft of it. PILOT has that same "work sim that becomes meditative" quality. The Mad Men comparison is setting and tone: a prestige period piece about an industry in transformation, where the characters' taste and instincts are their only real tools.

3. **Football Manager** — The management sim that became a lifestyle game. Football Manager proved that an audience will spend thousands of hours in a spreadsheet if the decisions feel consequential and the simulated world responds authentically. PILOT targets that same "one more season" compulsion loop, but in a setting that's never been served.

4. **Pentiment** — A mid-scope narrative game set in a specific historical period, where the player's choices have cascading consequences they don't fully understand until much later. Pentiment proved that period-specific settings with intellectual depth can find a passionate audience on Steam.

5. **The Movies (2005, Lionhead)** — The forgotten classic. A Hollywood studio sim that had remarkable ambition but never nailed the creative-decision layer. PILOT is the spiritual successor that actually delivers on the promise: the game where you shape the art, not just the business.

### Unique Selling Proposition

Show the GAME, not the features. Here's what no other game offers:

There is no management sim where you READ THE WORK and GIVE NOTES. Every other creative-industry sim abstracts the creative product into stats. PILOT puts you inside the editorial relationship — you read script excerpts, you watch rough cuts, you make specific creative calls that shape the final product. You don't manage television. You *taste* television. Your taste is the mechanic.

And there is no game set in this world. The 2000s golden age of television is one of the most fascinating, well-documented, passionately debated creative eras in modern culture — and nobody has made a game about it. The setting alone generates press coverage. The gameplay earns the setting.

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)**: Primary. This is where management sim audiences live, and Steam's algorithm will surface PILOT to wishlists that contain Game Dev Tycoon, Football Manager, and Pentiment. The depth of the Notes System and the volume of text demand a screen, a mouse, and a comfortable chair. Steam Next Fest demo with a single development season would be a perfect vertical slice.

**Mac**: Day-one parity. The TV-industry audience skews heavily Mac-using. Leaving it out is leaving audience on the table.

**Nintendo Switch**: Post-launch port. The session length (45-90 minutes per season) works well for handheld, and management sims perform on Switch. The text-heavy interface will need scaling work.

**Mobile**: Stretch consideration only. A simplified "Script Triage" mode could work as a standalone mobile companion — the 30-second loop of reading coverage and making snap pass/consider/priority calls is inherently phone-shaped. But the full game is PC-first.

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (non-negotiable)

1. **Script Triage & The Desk**: The information-management layer. Scripts arrive, you assess under time pressure, you decide what enters your development pipeline. This must feel physical, tactile, and slightly overwhelming — like an actual executive's desk during pilot season. The UI design here IS the game feel. Physical paper aesthetics. Coffee rings. Post-it notes. The controlled chaos of a creative executive's workspace.

2. **The Development Pipeline & Notes System**: The strategic and emotional core. Attaching talent, allocating budget, and — critically — giving notes that shape the creative product. The Notes System must present specific, authored creative dilemmas (not procedural fill-in-the-blank) and track their consequences across the life of a show. This is the pillar that makes PILOT more than a tycoon game. Every note is a story. Every compromise is a scar.

3. **Network Identity & The Brand**: The emergent strategy layer. Your decisions accumulate into a visible network profile that affects what opportunities you receive, how the industry perceives you, and what legacy you build. This must be legible to the player without being reducible to "optimize the prestige meter." The brand is a portrait, not a score.

4. **The Landscape & Industry Simulation**: The living world. Competing networks, shifting audience habits, real historical inflection points, and the macro-evolution from broadcast dominance to cable ascendance to the first hints of streaming. This is what gives your decisions context and urgency. Without the landscape, you're playing in a vacuum. With it, you're navigating history.

5. **Seasonal Rhythm & The Upfronts**: The structural backbone. The game's calendar — development season, pilot production, upfronts presentation, fall launch, ratings tracking, cancellation/renewal — provides a natural dramatic arc to every session. The upfronts sequence (presenting your slate to advertisers) is the set-piece moment of every season, the equivalent of a boss fight in a game that has no bosses.

### Stretch Goals (ordered by impact)

1. **The Writers' Room**: A deeper layer where you can sit in on writers' room sessions for your greenlit shows, making micro-decisions about episode arcs, character development, and season structure. This extends the Notes System from pilots into full series and dramatically deepens the creative engagement.

2. **Talent Career Arcs**: Showrunners, actors, and writers who evolve over time — rising stars who flame out, reliable hands who have a late-career renaissance, volatile geniuses who leave destruction in their wake. Their career arcs interweave with your decisions, creating emergent stories that feel authored.

3. **The Screening Room**: Stylized "rough cut" sequences where you watch key scenes from your pilots rendered in a limited-animation, storyboard aesthetic. This makes the shows you develop feel REAL rather than abstract — you see the work you've shaped, for better or worse.

4. **Awards Season**: Emmy campaigns, critical year-end lists, and the cultural conversation around your shows. Awards don't directly affect ratings, but they affect your reputation, your ability to attract talent, and your emotional investment in shows that might be commercially underperforming.

5. **The Rival Executive**: A named, characterized rival at a competing network who develops their own slate in parallel, makes visible creative choices, and serves as both antagonist and mirror. Their successes sting. Their failures comfort. Their taste challenges yours.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Playable show production**: You don't direct episodes, manage sets, or handle day-to-day production. You're the development executive, not the showrunner. The game's perspective is the office and the screening room, never the set.
- **Real licensed TV shows**: No recreations of actual shows. The game's fictional shows must evoke the era's archetypes without legal exposure. A show that FEELS like The Sopranos without BEING The Sopranos.
- **Multiplayer / competitive**: The fantasy is singular — you are THE exec. Multiplayer dilutes the power fantasy and the emotional weight.
- **Procedural script generation**: The scripts and creative dilemmas must be authored content. Procedural generation would destroy the Notes System's specificity, which is the entire point. The game needs a large authored content library, not an algorithm.
- **Post-2000s eras at launch**: The game is set in a specific historical moment for a reason. The early-to-mid 2000s are the crucible. Later eras (streaming wars, peak TV glut) are expansion territory, not base game.
- **Voiced dialogue**: The game is text-driven. The imagination does the acting. Voice work would eat budget that should go to authored content volume.

## KEY ART / MOOD DIRECTION

**Hero image**: A wide mahogany desk covered in pilot scripts, each with a different colored coverage sheet. A hand hovers over the pile, BlackBerry in the other hand, a rough-cut playing on a TV monitor in the background — the image frozen on a frame that could be brilliant or terrible. Through the floor-to-ceiling office window behind the desk, the LA skyline glows at magic hour. The composition says: power, taste, isolation. The desk is a throne and a trap.

**Color palette**: Warm ambers and institutional greens. The golden light of an LA office at 5 PM. Script pages in cream and white. Coverage sheets in primary colors — red for drama, blue for comedy, green for limited series. The palette of a world that's simultaneously corporate and creative, sterile and seductive.

**UI mood**: Physical and tactile. Scripts as actual document objects you can flip through. Coverage sheets with handwritten marginalia. A desk surface that accumulates clutter over the season — Post-its, trade magazines, business cards, screening invitations. The UI IS the desk. Menus are drawers. The calendar is a wall planner. Emails arrive on a period-appropriate computer interface — a Windows XP-era Outlook knockoff. The development pipeline is a physical whiteboard with index cards. Nothing feels like a game UI. Everything feels like a workspace.

**Typography**: Trade publication aesthetics. Variety and Hollywood Reporter headline fonts. Script pages in Courier. Coverage sheets in a clean serif. The game's own display text in a warm, slightly worn sans-serif that evokes 2000s editorial design — think early Pitchfork or Salon.

**Audio mood**: Quiet and environmental. The ambient hum of an office — distant phones, keyboard clicks, HVAC. Muzak in elevator transitions. The particular silence of a screening room. A subtle, warm score that draws from the era's prestige TV soundscapes — Thomas Newman-esque piano motifs, understated orchestral textures. Music swells during upfronts presentations and season finales. The sound of a phone ringing should be slightly Pavlovian by hour 10.

## OPEN QUESTIONS AND NEXT STEPS

### Design Questions [REED]
- How much script text does the player actually read? The Notes System demands enough context to make creative decisions meaningful, but too much text per script risks pacing death. What's the right excerpt length — a paragraph? A page? A scene?
- How does the Notes System avoid feeling binary? The goal is nuanced creative shaping, not "pick the good option." How many axes of creative identity does a single pilot need to make notes feel like genuine taste expression?
- What's the right number of simultaneous projects in the pipeline? Too few and the triage system is meaningless. Too many and the player can't engage deeply with any of them. The sweet spot is probably 8-12 in development, 3-5 going to series.
- How does the game communicate a show's quality without reducing it to a number? The rough cut screening, critic reviews, audience response, and cultural impact should all tell different stories about the same show. Can we avoid a single "quality score"?
- How does the Landscape simulation avoid feeling deterministic? The player should feel like they're navigating uncertainty, not solving a known puzzle. Historical events should create pressure, not prescribe solutions.

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]
- How many authored pilots need to exist in the content library for the game to feel deep? Each pilot needs a logline, a script excerpt, a set of creative dilemma notes, and branching outcomes based on development choices. Rough estimate: 60-80 pilot concepts minimum for a base game spanning 6-8 seasons.
- How do we write fictional shows that EVOKE real ones without BEING them? The player should recognize archetypes — "oh, this is the game's version of a Sopranos-type show" — without it feeling like parody or legal liability. The tone has to be reverent, not winking.
- Where's the emotional climax? Is it when you greenlight a show you believe in against all commercial logic? Is it when you cancel a beloved show? Is it when the retrospective narrator tells the story of your career? The game needs a moment that hits like the end of a great season of television.
- How does the rival executive become a character rather than a system? They need a name, a philosophy, a visible track record, and moments where the player can see their taste reflected in their choices. The rivalry should feel personal.
- What's the player character's interiority? Do we ever access their inner monologue, or is their taste expressed purely through action? There's a strong argument for silence — the player IS the character, and naming their feelings reduces the projection. But there's also an argument for occasional internal voice, à la a memoir narrator looking back.

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]
- The TV-industry audience is a publicity accelerator. When do we start seeding the concept to TV writers and critics? A Twitter thread from a real showrunner saying "someone finally made a game about my job" is worth $100K in marketing spend.
- What's the demo? A single development season — 3-4 pilots, one going to series, one getting killed. The player should experience the full triage-develop-notes-greenlight arc in 20 minutes. End on a cliffhanger: the ratings for your first series premiere, frozen mid-reveal.
- The 2000s nostalgia angle is potent but has to be handled carefully. We're not making a "remember when" nostalgia product — we're making a game about a specific historical moment that happens to trigger deep nostalgia. The marketing should lead with the DECISION FANTASY, not the PERIOD SETTING.
- What's the announcement trailer? A montage of script pages hitting a desk, faster and faster. Glimpses of coverage notes. A hand picking up a phone. A rough cut on a monitor. A conference room argument, rendered in text boxes. A headline: "NEW DRAMA BIGGEST HIT OF THE FALL." Another headline: "NETWORK'S BOLD GAMBLE ENDS IN HISTORIC FAILURE." The same hand. The same desk. Different scripts. End card: PILOT. "What gets made is up to you."
- Steam tags we're targeting: Simulation, Management, Strategy, Singleplayer, Story Rich, Choices Matter, 2000s, Television. We want to show up in queues for Game Dev Tycoon, Football Manager, and Pentiment simultaneously.

### Next Steps

1. **Prototype the Desk**: Build the script triage interface. Physical paper feel, time pressure, information hierarchy. If the 30-second loop of reading coverage and making pass/consider/priority calls doesn't feel good, nothing else matters.
2. **Author 10 pilot concepts**: Full creative dilemma trees — logline, excerpt, 3-4 notes per pilot, branching outcomes. Test whether the Notes System generates genuine creative tension or collapses into obvious optimization.
3. **Paper prototype the development season**: Map the full seasonal arc — from script arrivals through upfronts — on paper. Identify pacing beats, decision density, and the emotional rhythm of a single session.
4. **Build the Network Identity system on paper**: Define the axes. Test whether player choices create legible, emergent brand profiles. Verify that no single axis has an obviously dominant strategy.
5. **Mood art and UI prototype**: The desk IS the game. Commission concept art of the workspace interface — physical scripts, coverage sheets, the whiteboard pipeline, the screening room. If a screenshot of the desk doesn't immediately communicate the fantasy, iterate.
6. **Industry consultation**: Talk to actual development executives, showrunners, and TV journalists. The game's credibility depends on getting the texture right. One inauthentic detail and the TV-industry audience turns hostile.
7. **Steam page goes live the moment the desk screenshot exists.** The concept sells itself. We need wishlists accumulating while we build.

*This pitch document was generated by REED (Game Designer), NOVA (Narrative Designer), and HYPE (Marketing). The game lives or dies on one question: can the Notes System make the player feel like a creative collaborator — not a focus-group algorithm, not a rubber-stamp executive, but a person with taste who has to defend that taste against the machinery of commerce? If giving a note on a pilot script can feel like the most important decision in the world, PILOT is the management sim that nobody knew they were waiting for.*
